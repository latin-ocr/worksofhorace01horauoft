oon 11.] To Iulus Antonius. 157

Then, though in statelier power it lack‚
My voice shall swell the lay,
And sing, “ Ο glorious day,

O day thrice blest, that gives great Caesar back
To Rome, from hostile fray Ξ ”

“ Io Triumphe l ” thrice the cry;
“ Io Triumphe!'' loud
Shall shout the echoing crowd

The city through, and to the gods on high,
Raise incense like a cloud.

Ten bulls shall pay thy sacrifice,

With whom ten kine shall bleed:
1 to the fane will lead

A yearling of the herd‚ of modest size‚
From the luxuriant mead,

Δ Horned like the moon, when her pale light,
Which three brief days have fed,
She trimmeth, and, dispread
On his broad brows a spot of snowy white,
All else a tawny redfl‘·

 

θ “The glory of the herd‚ a bull
Snow-white, save 'twixt his horns one spot there grew ;
Save that one stain. he was of milky hue.”
—SHAKESPEARE.

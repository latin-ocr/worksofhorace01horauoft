72 To Barine‚ [Boox 11.

Mothers all dread thee sor their boys, and old

Fond fathers sear thy havoc with their gold;

The bane art thou of every new-made bride,

Lest thy soft air should wast her husband from her side.

THE SAME.
RE-TRANSLATED.

IF for thy perjuries and broken truth,
Barine‚ thou hadst ever come to harm,
Hadst lost, but in a nail, or blackened tooth,
One single charm,

I'd trust thee ; but when thou art most forsworn,
Thou blazest forth with beauty most supreme,
And of our young men art, noon, night, and mom,

The thought, the dream.

To thee ’tis gain thy mother’s dust to mock,
To mock the silent watch-fires of the night,
All heaven, the gods, on whom death's icy shock
Can never light.

Smiles Venus sels, I vow, to see thy artS‚
The guileless nymphs and cruel Cupid smile,
And, smiling, whets on bloody stone his darts
Of fire the while.

N ay more, our youth grow up to be thy prey,
New slaves throng round, and those who crouched at firs‘t,

σοι vnn] To Lydia. 15

For I hold Apollo’s promise,
That in other elimes a new

Salamis shall rise around us,
Fairer, nobler to the view Ξ

Now, ye brave hearts‚ that have weathered
Many a sorer strait with me,

Chase your cares with wine‚—to-morrow
We shall plough the mighty sea Ξ ”

ODE VIII.

To LYDIA.

HY, Lydia, why,
I pray, by all the gods above,
Art so resolved that Sybaris should die,
And all for' love?

Why doth he shun
The Campus Martius’ sultry glare? ’

He that once recked of neither dust nor sun,
Why rides he there,

First of the brave,
Taming the Gallie steed no more? ’λ

Why doth he shrink from Tiber’s yellow wave?
Why thus abhor

The wrestler's oil,
As ’twere from viper's tongue distilled?
Why do his arms no livid bruises soil,
He, once so skilled,

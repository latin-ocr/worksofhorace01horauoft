ODE XXV.
To LYDIA.

WAINS in numbers
Break your slumbers,
Saucy Lydia, now but seldom,
Ay, though at your casement nightly,
Tapping loudly, tapping lightly,
By the dozen once ye held them.

- Ever turning,
Night and morning,
Swung your door upon its hinge53
Now, from dawn till evening's closing‚
Lone and desolate reposing,
Not a soul its rest infringes.

Serenaders,
Sweet invaders,

Scanter grow, and daily scanter,
Singing, “ Lydia, art thou sleeping?
Lonely watch thy love is keeping!

Wake, oh wake, thou dear enchanter1”

Lorn and faded,
You, as they did,

Woo, and in your turn are slighted ;
Worn and torn by passion's fret,
You, the pitiless coquette,

Waste by fires yourself have lighted,

ont. xxm] To A rz'stz‘us Fuscus,

Place me beneath the sunbeams' fiercest glare,

On arid sands, no dwelling anywhere,

Still Lalage's sweet smile, sweet voice even there
I will adores*

³* Cowper has imitated this verse 2—-

“ Place me where Winter breathes his keenest air,
And I will sing, if Liberty be there ς
And Ι will sing qt Liberty's dear feet,
In Afric's torrid clime, or India’s fiercest heat.” ,
—Table Talk.

“ By night, by day, a-field, at hame,
The thoughts o' thee my breast inflame,
And aye Ι muse and sing thy name,
Ι only live to love thee.

‘¹ Th0ugh I were doomed to wander on,
Beyond the sea, beyond the sun,
Till my last weary sand was run,
Till then, and then Ι love thee.''
-BURNs.

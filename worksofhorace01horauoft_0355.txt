ODE V.
'ro AUGUSTUS.

ROM gods benign descended‚ thou
Best guardian of the fates of Rome,
T oo long already from thy home
Hast thou, dear chief, been absent now3

Oh, then return, the pledge redeem‚
Thou gav’st the Senate, and once more
Its light to all the land restore;

For when thy face, like springtide's gleam,

Its brightness on the people sheds,
Then glides the day more sweetly by,
A brighter blue pervades the sky,

The sun a richer radiance spreads Ξ

As on her boy the mother calls,
Her boy, whom envious tempests keep
Beyond the vexed Carpathian deep,
From his dear home, till winter falls,

And still with vow and prayer she eries,
Still gazes on the winding shore,

So yearns the country evermore
For Caesar, with fond, wist·ful eyes·

For safe the herds range field and fen,
Full·headed stand the shocks of grain,
Our sailors sweep the peaceful main,

And man can trust his fellow·men.

ODE XI.
To PHYLLxs.

HAVE laid in a cask of Albanian wine,
Which nine mellow summers have ripened and more;
In my garden, dear Phyllis, thy brows to entwine,
Grows the brightest of parsley in plentiful stote.

There is ivy to gleam on thy dark glossy hair3
'My plate, newly burnished, enlivens my rooms ;
And the altar, athirst for its vicfim, is there,
Enwreathed with chaste vervain‚ and choicest of blooms.

Every hand in the household is busily toiling,
And hither and thither boys bustle and girls ;
Whilst‚ up from the hearth·fires careering and coiling,
The smoke round the raster·beams languidly curls.

Let the joys of the revel be parted between us ἔ
'Tis the Ides of young April, the day which divides
The mouth, dearest Phyllis, of ocean—sprung Venus,
A day to me dearer than any besides.

And well may I prize it, and hail its returning—
My own natal day not more hallowed nor dear—

F or Maecenas, my friend, dates from this happy morning
The life which has swelled to a lustrous career.

You sigh for young Telephus ε better sorget him 1
His rank is not yours, and the gaudier charms
Of a girl that's both wealthy and wauton benet him,
And hold him the sondest of slaves in her arms.

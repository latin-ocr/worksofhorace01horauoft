' Ode to Lydia. cxv

The wre'stlers· oil,
. As 'twere from viper's tongue distilled ?
Why do his arms no livid bruises soil,
He, once so skilled,

The disc or dart
Far, far beyond the mark to hurl? ·

⁷ And tell me, tell me, in what nook apart,
Like baby-girl,

, Lurks the poor boy,
Veiling his manh00d‚ as did Thetis· son,

To scape war's bloody clang, while fated Troy
Was yet undone?

¹² 111 the same class with this poem may be ranked the

following ode (Ι. 27). Α Just as the poet has made us as

does he here transport us into the middle of a wine-party
of young Romam, with that vivid dramatic force which
constitutes one great source of the excellence of his

lyrics. ᾗ

“ Hold l hold l 'Tis for Thracian madmen to fight
With wine-cups‚ that only were made for delight.

- ’Τίς barbarous—-brutal l I beg of you all,
Disgrace not our banquet with bloodshed and brawl !

Sure, Median scimitars strangely accord

With lamps and with wine at the festival board l
'Tis out of all rule 1 Friends, your places resume,
And let us have order once more in the room l

If Ι am to join you in pledging a beaker

of this stout Falemian, choicest of liquor, · »
Megilla's fair brother must say, from what eyes
Flew the shaft, sweetly fatal, that causes his sighs.

How—<lumb 1 Tben I drink not a drop. Never blush,
Whoever the fair one may be, man l T ush, tush 1
She'll do your taste credit, I'm certain—for yours

Was always select in its little amours.

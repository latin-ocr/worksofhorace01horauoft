Remonstrates with Iccius, cxxxiii

playfully asks this studious friend (odes, Ι. 29), from
whom he expected better things—“pollicitus meliora ''—
if it be true that he grudges the Arabs their wealth‚
and is actually forging fetters for the hitherto invincible
Sabaean monarchs, and those terrible Medians? To
which of the royal damsels does he intend to throw the
handkerchief, having first cut down her princely betrothed
in single combat? Or what young “oiled and curled''
oriental prince is for the future to pour out his wine for
him? IcciuS‚ like many another Raleigh‚ went out to
gather wool, and came back shorn. The expedition
proved disastrouS‚ and he was lucky in being one of the
few who survived it. Some years afterwards we meet
with him again as the steward of Agrippa's great estates
in Sicily. He has resumed his studieS,—

“ On themes sublime alone intent,—
What oeuses the wild ocean sway,
The seasons what from June to May,
Π free the constellations roll,
Or moved by some supreme control;
What makes the moon obscure her light,
What pours her splendour on the night.''

Absorbed in these and similar inquirieS‚ and living
happily on “herbs and frugal fare‚'' Iccius realises the
noble promise of his youth 3 and Horace, in writing to
him (Epist.‚ Ι. 12), encourages him in his disregard of
wealth by some of those hints sor contentment which the
poet never tires of reproducing :—

‘ ‘ Let no care trouble you ;¹ for poor
That man is not, who can insure
Whate’er for life is needful found.
Let your digestion be but sound,

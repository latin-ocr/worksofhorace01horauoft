bade his landing, and he had to go on to Tarentum,
where terms were ultimately arranged for a renewal of
the triumvirate. The moment was a critical one, for an
open rupture between Octavius and Antony was im-
minent, which might well have proved disastrous to
the former, had Antony joined his fleet to that of the
younger Pompey, which, without his aid, had already
proved more than a match for the naval force of
Octavius.

To judge by Horace’s narrative, all the friends who
accompanied Maecenas on this occasion, except his co-
adjutor, Cocceius Nerva, who had three⁴ years before
been engaged with him on a similar mission to Brun-
dusium, were men whose thoughts were given more to
literature than to politics. Horace starts from Rome
with HeliodoruS, a celebrated rhetorician, and they make
their way very leisurely to Anxur (Terracina), where they
are overtaken by Maecenas,

‘⁸ ’Twas fixed that we should meet with dear
Maecenas and Cocceius here,
Who were upon a mission bound,
Of consequence the most profound;
For who so skilled the feuds to close
Of those, once friends, who now were foes?”

This is the only allusion throughout the poem to the
object of the journey. The previous day, Horace had
been balked of his dinner, the water being so bad, and
his stomach so delicate, that he chose to fast rather than
run the risk of making himself ill with it. And now at
Terracina he found his eyeS, which were weak, so trouble-
some, that he had to dose them well with a black wash.

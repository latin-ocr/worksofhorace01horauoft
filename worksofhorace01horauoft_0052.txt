xlviii Life of Horace.

from temperament or policy, or both, he set his face
against the system of cruelty and extermination which
disgraced the triumvirate. When Octavius was one day
condemning man after man to death, MaecenaS‚ after a
vain attempt to reach him on the tribunal, where he sat
surrounded by av dense crowd, wrote upon his tablets,
Surge, tandem, Carnifix !—— “ Butcher, break off! '² and
flung them across the crowd into the lap of Caesar, who
felt the rebuke, and immediately quitted the judgment-
seat. His policy was that of conciliation; and while
bent on the establishment of a monarchy, from what we
must fairly assume to have been a patriotic conviction
that this form of government could alone meet the
exigencies of the time, he endeavoured to combine this
with a due regard to individual liberty, and a free expres-
sion of individual opinion.

At the time of Horace's introduction to him, Maecenas
was probably at his best, in the full vigour of his intellect‚
and alive with the generous emotions which must have
animated a man bent as he was on securing tranquillity
sor the state, and healing the strife of factions‚ which
were threatening it with ruin. His chief relaxation from
the fatigue of public life waS, to all appearance, found in
the society of men of letterS‚ and, judging by what Horace
says (Satires, Ι. 9), the vie intime of his social circle must
have been charming. To be admitted within it was a
privilege eagerly coveted, and with good reason, for not
only was this in itself a stamp of distinction, but his
parties were well known as the pleasantest in Rome :—-

“ No house more free from all that3s base,
In none cabals more out os place.

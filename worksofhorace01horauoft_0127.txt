Horace to Phyllis. cxxiii

To leave the placens uxor—“ the winsome wife '’—

’ behind, is one of the saddest regretS, Horace tells his

friend Posthumus (Odes‚ ΙΙ. 14), which death can bring.
Still Horace only sang the praises of marriage, contenting
himself with painting the Eden within which, for reasons
unknown to uS, he never sought to enter. He was well
up in life, probably, before these sager views dawned
upon him. Was it then too late to reduce his precepts
to practice, or was he unable to overcome his dread of
the dotata conjux, and thought his comfort would be safer ὕ
in the hands of some less exacting fair, such as the Phyllis

to whom the following Ode, one of his latest (IV. 11), is
addressed P—

⁸ ¹ I have laid in a cask of Albanian wine,
Which nine mellow Summers have ripened and more ;
In my garden, dear Phyllis, thy brows to entwine,
Grows the brightest of parsley in plentiful store.
There is ivy to gleam on thy dark glossy hair ;
My plate. newly burnished, enlivens my rooms;
And the altar, athirst for its victim, is there,
Enwreathed with chaste vervain and choicest of blooms.

Every hand in the household is busily toiling,
. And hither and thither boys bustle and girls ;⁴
Whilst, up from the hearth-fires careering and coiling,
The smoke round the rafter·beams languidly curls.
Let the joys of the revel be parted between us !
'T is the Ides of young April, the day which divides
The mouth, dearest Phyllis, of ocean-sprung Venus,—
A day to me dearer than any besides.

And well may 1 prize it, and hail its returning—
My own natal day not more hallowed nor dear;

For Maeoenas, my friend, dates from this happy morning
The lise which has swelled to a lustrous career.

Yon sigh for young Telephus : better soi-get him l
His rank is not yours, and the gaudier chax-ms

Of a girl that's both wealthy and wauton benet him, ·
And hold him the fondest of slaves in her arms.

114 To tlte Romans, [Boon 111.

But they, of rustic warriors wight
The manly offspfing, learned to smite
The soil with Sabine spade,
And saggots they had cut to bear
Home from the forest, whensoe'er
An austere mother bade3

What time the sun began to change

The shadows through the mountain range,
And took the yoke away

From the o’er-wearied oxen, and

His parting car proclaimed at hand
The kindliest hour of day.

How Time doth in its flight debase
Whate’er it finds! Our fathers' race,
More deeply versed in ill
Than were their sires, hath borne us yet
More wicked, duly to beget
A race more vicious still.

cxxii szfe of Horace.

strongly in his heart the thought of what a tender and
pure-souled woman had been in his friend's horne, when
he wrote his exquisite lines to Calvus on the death of
Quinctilia :—-

’· Calvus, if those now *silent in the tomb
Can feel the touch of pleasure in our tears
For those we loved, that perished in their bloom,
And the departed friends of former years—
oh, then, full surely thy Quinctiua's woe
For the untimely fate, that bids thee part.
Will fade before the bliss she feels to know
How very dear she is unto thy beart 1¹· ²

Horace, the bachelor‚ revered the marriage-tie, and did
his best, by his verseS, to forward the policy of Augustus
in his effort to arrest the decay of morals by enforcing
the duty of marriage, which the well-to-do Romans of
that day were inclined to shirk whenever they could.
N ay, the charm of constancy and conjugal sympathy
inspired a few of his very finest lines (odes, Ι. 13)—
“Eelices ter et amplius quos irrupta tenet copula‚” &c.,—
the feeling of which is better preserved in Moore's well-
known paraphrase than is possible in mere translation :—

¹⁸ There’s a bliss beyond all that the minstrel has told,

When two that are linked in one heavenly tie,
With heart never changiug, and brow never cold.

Love on through all ills, and love on tiu they die l
One hour of a passion so sacred is worth

Whole ages of heartless and wandering bliss ς
And oh l if there be an Elysium on earth,

It is this, it is this 1⁹·

1 In the same spirit is the following passage in the exquisite letter of
condolence, in which Ser. Sulpicius remonstrates with Cicero on his
excessive grief for the death of his daughter Tullia: ‘¹ Quod si qui etiam
inferis sensus est, qui illius in te amor suit, pietasque in omnes suos, hoc
certe illa te facere non vuit.”

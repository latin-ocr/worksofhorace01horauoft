To flffaecenas. [Boox 111.

See, now Andromeda's bright sire
Reveals his erewhile hidden rays,
Now Procyon flames with fiercest fire,

Mad Leo's star is all ablaze,
For the revolving sun has brought
The season round of parching drought.

Now with his spent and languid fiocks
The wearied shepherd seeks the shade,

The river coel, the shaggy rocks, ’
That overhang the tangled glade,

And by the stream no breeze's gush

Disturbs the universal hush. ’

Thou dost devise with sleepless zeal

What course may best the state beseem,
And, fearful for the City’s weal,

Weigh'st anxiously each hostile scheme,
That may be hatching far away
In Scythia, India, or Cathay.

Most wisely Jove in thickest night
The issues of the future vens,

And laughs at the sels-torturing wight,
Who with imagined terrors quails.

The present only is thine own,

Then use it well, ere it has flown.

All else which may by time be bred
Is like a river of the plain,
Now gliding gently o'er its bed
Along to the Etruscan main,
Now whirling onwards, fierce and fast,
Uprooted trees, and boulders vast,

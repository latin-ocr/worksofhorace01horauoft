Canidz'a’s Incantatz'on. xli

The moon, all bloody red of hue,
Behind the massive tombs withdrew.”

The hags pursue their incantations; higher and higher
flames their ghastly fire, and the grizzled wolves and
spotted snakes slink in terror to their holeS, as the
shrieks and muttered spells of the beldams make the
moon-forsaken night more hideous. But after piling up
his horrors with the most elaborate skin, as if in the view
of some terrible climaX‚ the poet makes them collapse
into utter farce. Disgusted by their intrusion on his
privacy, the Priapus adopts a simple but exceedingly
vulgar expedient to alarm these appalling hagS. In an
instant they fall into the most abJect terror, suspend
their incantationS, and, tucking up their skirtS‚ make off
for the more comfortable quarters of the city as fast as
their trembling limbs can carry them—Canidia, the great
enchantreSS, dropping her false teeth‚ and her attendant
Sagana parting company with her wig, by the way :—
⁴⁸ While you
With laughter long and loud might view

Their herbs, and charmed adders wound‘
In mystic coils, bestrew the ground.''

And yet grave scholars gravely ask us to believe that
Canidia was an old mistress of the poet’s l These poems
evidently made a succeSS, and Horace returned to the
theme in his 17th Epode. Here he writes as though he
had been put under a spell by Canidia, in revenge for
his former calumnies about her.

‘¹ My youth has fied, my rosy hue
Turned to a wan and livid blue;
Blanched by thy mixtures is my haim
No respite have 1 from despair.

ODE XXI Ι Ι.
ΤΟ CHLOE.

AY, hear me, dearest chum, pray!
You shun me like a timid fawn‚
That seeks its mother all the day

By forest brake and upland lawn, 3
Of every passing breeze afraid,
And leaf that twitters in the glade.

Let but the wind with sudden rush
The whispers of the wood awake,
Or lizard green disturb the hush,
Quick-darting through the grassy brake,
The foolish frightened thing will start,
With trembling knees and beating heartff·

* The same idea has been baeutifully worked out by Spenser‚ in
whom, and in Milton, the influence of Horace's poetry is perhaps more
frequently traceable than in any of our poets :—

¹⁴ Like as an hynde forth singled from the herde,
That hath escaped from a ravenous bfflst,
Yet flies away, of her own feet afearde3
And every leaf, that shaketh with the least
Murmure of winde, her terror hath enereast;
So fied sayre Florimel from her vaine feare,
Long· aster she from perill was releast;
Each shade she saw, and each noyse she did heare,
Did seeme to be the same, which she escaypt whileare.“
-Fairy Queen, 111. vii. 1.

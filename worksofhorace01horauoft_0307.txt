ODE VII.

To ASTERsE.

WHY weep, Asterie, for the youth,
That soul of constancy and truth‚
Whom from Bithynia’s· shore,

Rich with its-wares, with gentle wing

The west winds shall in early spring
To thy embrace restore?

Driven by the southern gales, when high
Mad Capra's star ascends the sky,

To Oricum, he keeps
Sad vigils through the freezing nights,
And, thinking of his lost delights

With thee, thy Gyges weeps.

Yet in a thousand artful ways ⁴
His hostess’ messenger essays
To tempt him, urging how
Chloe—for such her name-is doomed
By fires like thine to be consumed‚
And sigh as deep as thou ;v

N arrating, how by slanders vile

A woman's falsehood did beguile
The credulous Proetus on,

To hurry, with untimely haste,

Into the toils of death the chaste,
Too chaste‚ Bellerophon.

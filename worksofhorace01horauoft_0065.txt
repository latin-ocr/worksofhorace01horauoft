illustrationS, the most everyday topics—-if they come in
the way—are made use of for the purpose of insinuating
or enforcing some useful truth. Point and epigram are
the last things thought of ; and therefore it is that Pope's
translationS, admirable as in themselves they are, fail to

To genius, to the man whose soul is touched with fire divine.

Whose voice speaks like a trumpet-note, that honoured name assign.
..... ’Tis not enough that you compose your verse

In diction irreproachable‚ pure, scholarly, and terse,

Which, dislocate its cadence‚ by anybody may

Be spoken like the language of the father in the play.

Divest those things which now I write, and Lucilius wrote os yore,
Os certain measured cadences, by setting that before

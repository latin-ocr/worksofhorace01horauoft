170 To Lollius. [Boon ιν.

What were great Mavors, and Ilia's son,

Had envious silence his merits suppressed ?
Styx’s dark flood had o’er AEacus run,

But song bore him on to the Isles of the Blest.

Dowered by the Muse with a home in the sky,
Ne’er can he perish, whom she doth approve t
Dauntless Alcides thus revels on high,
Guest at the coveted banquets of Jove.

So the Twin StarS, as through tempests they glow,
Save the spent seaman, when most he despairs ;

Bacchus, with vine leaves fresh garlanded, so
Brings to sair issues his votary's pray’rs.

ODE IX.

ΤΟ LOLLIUS.

N EVER deem they must perish, the verses, which I,
Who was born where the waters of Aufidus roar,
To the chords of the lyre with a cunning ally
Unknown to the bards of my country before!

Though Maeonian Homer unrivalled may reign,
Yet are not the Muses Pindaric unknown,

The threats of Alcaeus, the Ceian's sad strain,
And stately Stesichorus' lordlier tone.

Unforgot is the sportive Anacreon's lay,

Stin, still sighs the passion, unquenched is the fire,
Which the Lesbian maiden, in days far away,

From her love-laden bosom breathed into the lyre.

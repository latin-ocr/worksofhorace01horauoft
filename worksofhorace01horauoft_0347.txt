ODE ΙΙ.
To IULUs ANTONIUS.

ULUS, he who'd rival Pindar's fame
On waxen wings doth sweep
The Empyrean steep,
To fall like Icarus, and with his name
Endue the glassy deep.

Like to a mountain stream, that roars
From bank to bank along,
XVhen autumn rains are strong,

So deep-mouthed Pindar lists his voice, and pours
His fierce tumultuous song.

Worthy Apollo's laurel wreath‚
Whether he strike the lyre
To love and young desire,

While bold and lawless numbers grow beneath
His mastering touch of fire3

Or sings of gods, and monarchs sprung ·
’ Of gods, that overthrew
The Centaurs, hideous crew,
And, fearless of the monster’s fiery tongue,
The dread Chimaera slew3

Or those the Elean palm doth list
To heaven, for winged steed‚
Or sturdy arm decreed,

Civing, than hundred statues nobler gift,
The poet’s deathless mead;

To Calliope. [noox 111.

His bow aside, who laves his locks unshorn
In Castaly’s pure dew, ’
Divine Apollo, who

Haunts Lycia's woodland glades‚ in Delos born,
In Patara worshipped too.

Unreasoning strength by its own weight must fall 3‘*
To strength with wisdom blent
Force by the gods is lent,

Who hold in scorn that strength, which is on all
That’s impious intent.

See hundred-handed Gyges helpless lie,
To make my maxim good,
Orion too, that would

Lay ruffian hands on chaste Diana, by
Her virgin shafts subdued.

Upheaved above the monsters she begot‚
Earth wails her children whirled
To Orcus’ lurid world,

By vengeful bolts, and the swift fite hath not
Pierced AEtna o'er it hurled.

Nor does the vulture e'er, sin’s warder grim,
Lewd Tityus' liver quit,
But o’er him still doth sit ;

Pirithous, too, lies settered, limb to limb
By chains three hundred knit.

θ’ “ But what is strength without a double share
Of wisdom? Vast, unweildy‚ burdensome,
Proudly secure, yet liable to fan.'·
—Samson Agonia-tes, 53.

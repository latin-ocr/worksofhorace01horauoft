ODE Ι.
THE PAINS οἳ Lovss.

ALTERED FROM BEN JONSON.

ENUS, dost thou renew a fray
Long intermitted? Spare me, spare, I pray Ξ
1 am not such as in the reign
Of the good Cinara 1 was. Refrain,
Sweet Love’s sour mother, him to school,
NVhom lustres ten have hardened to thy rule,
And soft behests; and hie thee where
Youth calls to thee with many a fondling pr.ayer l
More fitly-if thou seek to fire
A bosom apt for love and young desire-—
Corne, borne by bright·winged swans, and thus
Revel in the house of Paulus Maximus ;
Since, noble, and of graces choice,
For troubled clients voluble of voice,
And lord of countless arts‚ afar
Will he advance the banners of thy war.
And when he shall with smiles behold
His native charms eclipse his rival’s gold,
He will thyself in marble rear,
Beneath a cedarn roof near Alba’s mere.
There shall thy dainty nostril take
In many a gum, and for thy soft ear's sake

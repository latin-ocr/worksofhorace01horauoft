To Thalz'archus. [Boox 1.

The dise or dart
Far, far beyond the mark to hurl?
And tell me, tell me, in what nook apart,

Like baby-girl,

Lurks the poor boy,
Veiling his manhood, as did Thetis’ son,

To 'scape war’s bloody clang‚ while fated Troy
Was yet undone?

ODE IX.
‘ro THALIARCHUS.

EE, Thaliarch, see, across the plain
Soracte white with snow Ξ
Scarce may the labouring woods sustain
Their load, and locked in icy chain
The streams have ceased to flow.

Logs on the fire, your biggest‚ fling,
To thaw the pinching cold,

And from the time to take its sting

A pipkin forth of Sabine bring
Four mellowing summers old.

All else unto the Gods leave we ς
When they have stilled the'roar

Of winds that with the yeasty sea

Conflict and brawl, the cypress-tree‚
The old ash shake no more.

Alcides, too, and Leda’s sons I'll sound,
Illustrious twins, that are

For wrestling this, that for the race renowned,
Soon as whose kindly star

Upon the shipman gleams, amid the tempest's war

Down from the rocks the weltering surges fall,
The winds in zephyrs creep,
Back from the sky is rolled its cloudy pall,
And far along the deep
The threat'ning waves—for so they wiu— are lulled to sleep.

What next shall fill the burden of my strain,
Ι wist not to decide ;

Or Romulus, or N uma's tranquil reign,
Or Tarquin in his pride,

Or him of Utica, the brave, that nobly died.

Next Regulus, and the Scauri, Paulus too,
That flung his soul away,
His mighty soul‚ when Punic foes o’erthrew
Our strength that fatal day,
With grateful pride I'll chant in my undying 1ay;

Fabricius too, and Curius of the locks
Unkempt,-—Camillus,-all
N urtured to warfare by the daily shocks

Of penury, in the small
Paternal farm and cot that made of wealth their alh*

ὕ “ Plenty and peace breeds eowards ς hardness ever

Of hardiness is mother.''
—Cymbeline, Act 111. Sc. 6.

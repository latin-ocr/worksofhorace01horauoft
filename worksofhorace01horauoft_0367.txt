· Remember fond Phaeton’s fiery sequel,

 

And heavenward-aspiring Bellerophon’s fate 3

And pine not for one who would ne'er be your equal‚
But level your hopes to a lowlier mate.

So, come, my own Phyllis, my heart's latest treasure‚-—
Ah, ne'er for another this bosom shall long,—

And 1’11 teach, while your loved voice re-echoes the measure,
How to lighten feu care hythe cadence of song.

ODE XII.

TO VIRGIL.

N OW the sost gales of Thrace, that sing peace to the

ocean,
Spring’s handmaids, are wasting the barks from the shore,
There is life in the meadS, in the groves there is motion,
And snow-swollen torrents are raving no more.

Now buildeth her nest, whilst for Itys still sadly
She mourns, the poor bird, who was fated to shame “

The line of old Cecrops for ever, by madly
Avenging· the bruta] barbarian’s flame.

. On the young grass reclineq, near the murmur of fountains,

The shepherds are piping the songs of the plains‚
And the god, who loves Arcady's purple—hued mountains‚
The God of the Flocks‚ is entranced by their strains. Ι

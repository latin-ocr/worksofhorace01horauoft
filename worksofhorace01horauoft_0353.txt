And Asdrubal, thy vanquished foe,
And that auspicious day,
Which through the scattered gloom broke forth with smiling

ray.

? When joy again to Latium came,
⁵ Nor longer through her towns at ease
The fatal Lybian swept‚ like flame
‚Among the forest treeS,
Or Eurus' headlong gust across Sicilian seas.

Thenceforth, for with success they toiled,
Rome's youth in vigour waxed amain,
And temples, ravaged and despoiled,
By Punic hordes profane,
Upraised within their shrines beheld their gods again.

Till spoke salse Hannibal at length ;
“ Like stags, of ravening wolves the prey,
Why rush to grapple with their strength,
· From whom to steal away
= Theloftiest triumph is, they leave for us to-day?

 

“ ssat racc, inflexible as brave,
From Ilium quenched in flames, who bore
Across the wild Etruscan wave
Their babes, their grandsires hoar,
And all their sacred thingS, to the Ausonian shore;

‘⁴ Like oak‚ by sturdy axes lopped

Of all its boughs, which once the brakes
Of shaggy Algidus o 'ertopped,

Its loss its glory makes,

And from the very steel fresh strength and spirit takes.

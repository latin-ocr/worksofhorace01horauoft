The Adriatic billows dash,-
Nor Jove’s dread thunder-launching hand,

Yea, if the globe should fall, he'll stand
Serene amidst the crash.

Pollux of yore, and Hercules

The starry eminences gained,

Where Caesar, with lips purple-stained‚
Quaffs nectar, stretched at ease.

To bear the yoke thy pards didst school,
Through this same power Quirinus fled,
By Mars’ own horses charioted,
The Acherontine pool.

What time the gods to council came,

And Juno spoke with gracious tone,
“ That umpire lewd and doomed to shame,
And his adulterous foreign dame

Troy, Troy have overthrown;

His views on Dz’et. xcv

⁸· Tbere is Avidienus, to whom, like a burr,
Sticks the name he was righteously dubbed by of ‘ Cur,'
Eats beechmast and olives five years old, at least, ,
And even when he’s robed all in white for a feast
On his marriage or birth day, or some other very
High festival day, when one likes to be merry,
What wine from the chill of his cellar emerges—
'Tis a drop at the best—has the flavour of ve1·juice;
While from a huge cruet his own sparing hand
On his ooleworts drops oil which no mortal can stand,
So utterly loathsome and rancid in smell, it
Defies his stale vinegar even to quell it.”

Let what you have be simple, the best of its kind, what-
ever that may be, and served in the best style. And now
leam, continues the rustic sage,

‘¹ In what way and how greatly you'll gain

By using a diet both sparing and plain.

First, your health will be good ; for you readily can
Believe how much mischief is done to a man

By a great mass of dishes‚—remembering that

Plain fare of old times, and how lightly it sat.

But the moment you mingle up boiled with roast meat,
And shell-fish with thrushes, what tasted so sweet
Will be turned into bile, and ferment, not digest, in
Your stomach exciting a tumult intestine.
· Mark, from a bewildering dinner how pale

Every man rises up! Nor is this all they ail,

For the body, weighed down by its last night's excesses,
To its own wretched level the mind, t00, depresses,
And to earth chains that spark of the essence divine;
While he, that’s content on plain viands to dine,
Sleeps off his fatigues without effort, vthen gay

As a lark rises up to the tasks of the day.

Yet he on occasion will find himself able

To enJoy without hurt a more liberal table,

Say, on festival days, that come round with the year,
Or when his strength’s low, and eries out for good cheer,
Or when, as years gather, his age must be nursed
With more delicate care than he wanted at first.

But sor you, when ill health or old age shall befall,
Where's the luxury left, the relies within call,

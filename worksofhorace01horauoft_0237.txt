· The Furies some to Mars’ grim sport consign,

The hungry waves devour
The seaman, young and old drop hour by hour,
No single head is spared by ruthless Proserpine.

Me, too, the headlong gust‚
That dogs Orion, ’neath the billows thrust.
But, prithee, seamen, shed
On my unburied head
And limbs with gentle hand some grains of drifting dust Ξ
So may the storm that threats the western deep
Turn all its wrath away,
To smite the forests of Venusia,
And thou thy course secure o'er the mild ocean keep!

So may from every hand
Wealth rain on thee by righteous Jove's command Σ
And Neptune, who doth bear
Tarentum in his care
Bfing thy rich-laden argosy to land Σ
Deny me this, the common tribute due,
And races to be born
of thy sons’ sons in after-years forlorn,
T hough guiltless of thy crime, thy heartless scorn shall rue 1

Nor shall thyself go free,
For F ate’s vicissitudes shall follow thee,
Its laws, that slight for slight, - ’
And good for good requite Ξ
Not unavenged my bootless pray'r shall be,
Nor victim ever expiate thy guilt.
- Oh, then, though speed thou must—-
It asks brief tarrying—thrice with kindly dust
Bestrew my corpse, and then press onward as thou wilt 1

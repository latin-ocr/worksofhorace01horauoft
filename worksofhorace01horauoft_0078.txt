lxxiv Life of Horace.

hoe. There was a rough wildness in the scenery and a
sharpness in the air, both of which Horace liked, al-
though, as years advanced and his health grew more deli-
cate, he had to leave it in the colder months for T ivoli
or Baiae. He built a villa upon it, or added to one
already there, the traces of which still exist. The farm
gave employment to five families of free coloni, who were
under the superintendence of a bailiff3 and the poet’s
domestic establishment was composed of eight slaves.
The site of the farm is at the present day a favourite
resort of travellers, of Englishrnen especially, who visit
it in such numbers, and trace its features with such
enthusiasm, that the resident peasantry, “who cannot
conceive of any other source of interest in one so long
dead and unsainted than that of co-patriotism or con-
sanguinity,'' believe Horace to have been an English·
man.¹ What aspect it presented in Horace's time we
gather from one of his Epistles (1. 16) :—-

“ As, dearest Quintus, you may wish to know
The things this country place of mine wiu grow,
If it enrich me with oil, apples, wine,

Oris its fields are best for corn or kine,

Its site and character 1 will essay

To picture for you in my chatty way.

Girdled by hills it lies, through which but one
Small valley‚ rich in shade, is seen to run,
where on the right the morning sunbeams play,
Whilst on the left they rest at close of day.
You'd like the air. Wild cherry there, and sloe
Purply and daria in rich profusiori grow,

While oak and ilex bounteously afford .

Food for my herds, and shelter for their lord.
‘How's this ἲ· you’d say, could you behold the scene ;
¹ Tarentum's here, with all its wealth of green.'

75

ODE X.
To LICINIUS.

F thou wouldst live secure and free,
Thou wilt not keep far out at sea
Licinius, evermore3
Nor, fearful of the gales that sweep
The ocean wide, too closely creep
Along the treacherous shore.

The man, who, with a soul serene,
Doth cultivate the golden mean,
Escapes alike from all
The squalor of a sordid cot,
And from the jealousies begot
By wealth in lordly hall.

The mighty pine is ever most
By wild winds swayed about and tossed,
With most disastrous crash
Fau high-topped towers‚ and ever, where
The mountains' summit points in air,
Do bolted lightnings flash.

When fortune frowns, a well-trained mind
will hope for change ;·'‘· when she is kind,

⁴* ‘⁴ Sed credula vitam
Spes fovet, et melius cras fore semper ait.⁸'

—TmULLus, 11. 6. 19.

‘¹ By trustsul hope our life is comforted,
For ever whispering of a joy to be.''

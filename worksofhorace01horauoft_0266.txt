Did not through all their lengthened tale
His loved Antilochus bewail:

Nor did his parents, lonely left,

Of their still budding darling rest, ⁴

Nor Phrygian sisters evermore

The slaughtered Troilus deplore.

Forbear, then, longer to comphin,
Renounce this enervating strain,
And rather let us, thou and Ι,
Combine to sing in measures high
The trophies newly won by great
Augustus Caesar for the state;

N iphates' icy peak, the proud
Euphrates, added to the crowd
Of nafions, that confess our power,

A humbler river from this hour,
And the Gelonians forced to rein
Their steeds within a bounded plain.

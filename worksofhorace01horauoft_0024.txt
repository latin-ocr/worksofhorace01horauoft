xx ‘L zjfe os Horace.

Horace, has become a name (plagosus Orbilius, Orbilius
of the birch) eagerly applied by many a suffering urchin

y to modern pedagogues who have resorted to the same

material means of inculcating the beauties of the classics,

other Greek authors, Horace's father took care that
he should acquire all the accomplishments of a Roman

introduction to the seductions of the capital, he enjoyed
the advantages of his father's personal superintendence
and 'of a careful moral training. His father went with
him to all his classeS, and, being himself a man of shrewd
observation and natural humour, he gave the boy⁷s studies
a practical bearing by directing his attention to the follies
and vices of the luxurious and dissolute society around
him, showing him how incompatible they were with the
dictates of reason and common-sense, and how disastrous
in their consequences to the good name and happiness
of those who yielded to their seductions· The method
he pursued is thus described by Horace (SatireS, Ι. 4)-
¹‘ Should then my humorous vein run wild‚ some latitude allow.
I learned the habit from the best of fathers, who employed
Some living type to stamp the vice he wished me to avoid.

Thus temperate and frugal when exhorting me to be,
And with the competence content which he had stored for me,

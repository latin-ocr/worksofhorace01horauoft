ODE XXXVII.
'ro ms COMPANIONS.

OW, comrades‚ fill each goblet to the brim,
Now,now with bounding footstep strike the ground,
With costliest offerings every fane be crowned‚
Laud we the gods with thousand-voiced hymn!

It had been impious, till this glad hour

To bid our grandsires' Caecuban to flow,

While Egypt’s queen was listed to o'erthrow
Rome's empire, Rome melfi—home, temple, tower 1

Oh doting dream l—She, with her eunuch train,
Effeminate and vile, to conquer us Ξ
Drunk wit-h success, and madly venturous,
Swift ruin quelled the fever of her brain.

Her fleet, save one poor bark, in flames and wrack‚
The srenzied fumes, by Egypt’s vintage bred,
v Were turned to real terrors as she fled;
Fled from our shores with Caesar on her track.

As hawk pursues the dove, as o'er the plains
Of snow·wrapt Scythia, like the driving wind,·
The huntsman tracks the hare, he swept behind,
To fix that fair and fatal pest in chains.

But hers no spirit was to perish meanly ;
A woman, yet not womanishly weakj'ss'·
She ran her galley to no sheltering creek,
Nor quailed before the sword, but met it queen1y‚

⁴* ⁴⁴ My resolution's placed, and Ι have nothing

Of woman in me.''
—Anlony and Cleopatra, Act v. Sc. 2.

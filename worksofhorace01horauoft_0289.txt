BOOK 111.

ODE Ι.
IN PRAISE OF CONTENTMENT.

E rabble rout‚ avaunt!
Your vulgar din give o’er,
Whilst 1, the Muses' own hierophant,
To the pure ears of youths and virgins chant
In strains unheard before!

Great kings, whose frown doth make
Their crouching vassals quake,
Themselves must own
The mastering sway of Jove, imperial -god,
Who, from the crash of giants overthrown,
Triumphant honours took, and by his nod
Shakes all creation's zone.

Whate'er our rank may be,
We all partake one common destinyl
In fair expanse of soil,
Teeming with rich returns of wine and oil‚
His neighbour one outvies;
Another claims to rise
To civic dignities,
Because of ancestry, and noble birth,

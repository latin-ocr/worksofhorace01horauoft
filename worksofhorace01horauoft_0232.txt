40 To Vz‘rgz'l. [Boox 1.

What though thou modulate the tuneful shell
With dester skill than Orpheus of old Thrace,
When deftliest he played, and with its spell
Moved all the listening forest from its place?
Yet never, never can thy art avail
To bring lise's glowing tide back to the phantom pale,

VVhom with his black inexorable wand
Hermes, austere and pitiless as fate,
Hath forced to join the dark and spectral band
In their sad journey to the Stygian gate.
'Tis hard, great heavens‚ how hard Ξ But to endure
Alleviates the pang we may nor crush nor cure Εἴ·

³⁶ Plautus had expressed this venerable truism in nearly the same
language :-

“ Optimum est pati, quod emendare non possis.'·
—Capt. 2. 1. 1.

‘⁸ 'Tis best to bear with what you mnnot mend.''
Virgil with his usual skill lifted the idm above the level of common·
place, thus :—
⁴¹ Superanda omnis fortuna serendo est.''
—AEn. v. 710.
Which Campbell has translated to perfection in the line-
“ To bearis to conquer our fate.''

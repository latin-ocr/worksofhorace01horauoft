Principles of T ranslatz'on. clxxxvii

cal prose, it is obvious that a greater freedom of hand-
ling is‘not only permissible, but indispensable, than could
be justified in the case of the Odes. In fact, without
occasional expansion, and filling in of the links necessary
to bring out the author's meaning and intention, it would
be impossible to make Horace intelligible to a merely
English reader. Even here, however, the translator is
bound to apply to himself the rigorous axiom which
govemed Horaee's own practice—-

'¹ Prune the luxuriant, the uncouth retine,
And show no mercy to an empty line.'’

In a few instances where, for obvious reasons, a literal
reproduction of the original was not desirable, as in the
25th Ode of the First‚ and the 10th Ode of the Fourth
BookS, and in occasional passages elsewhere, both in the
Odes and SatireS, the translator has not hesitated to
make such deviations from the text as are required by
the purer morals of the present day. For the same
reason the 8th and 12th EpodeS, and thesgreater portion
of the 2d Satire of the First Book, have been altogether
omitted. A translator of the nineteenth century must
feel with tenfold force what Quinctilian long ago ex-
pressed—et Horatium nolim in quibusdam zbzterpretari.
It would be to his shame if his book were not such as
could raise no blush on the cheek of a good woman.

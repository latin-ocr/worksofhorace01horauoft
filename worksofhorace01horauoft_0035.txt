principles of the philosophie schools from which he had
so recently come, irritated by the thousand mortifica—
tions to which a man of cultivated tastes and keenly

when Horace saw that triumphs gained in this way were
of little value, and when he was anxious that his friends
should join with him in consigning his smart and scur-
rile lines (celeres et criminosos lambos) to oblivion. The
amende for some early lampoon which he makes in the
Ode just quoted, though ostensibly addressed to a lady
who had been its victim, was probably intended to cover

many after-regretS. That Horace in‘his early writings was

language and from a few of the poems of this class and
period which survive. Some of these have no value,

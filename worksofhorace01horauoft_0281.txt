The blustering tyrant of the western deep,
This well 1 know, my friend,

Our stars in wondrous wise one orbit keep,
And in one radiance blend.

From thee were Saturn's baleful rays afar

Averted by great Jove's refulgent star,

And his hand stayed F ate's downward·swooping wing‚
When thrice with glad acclaim

The teeming theatre was heard to ring,
And thine the honoured name:

So had the falling timber laid me low,

But Pan in mercy warded off the blow‚

Pan who keeps watch o’er easy souIs like mine.
Remember, then, to rear

In gratitude to Jove a votive shrine,
And slaughter many a steer‚

Whilst 1, as fits‚ an humbler tribute pay,

And a meek lamb upon his altar lay.

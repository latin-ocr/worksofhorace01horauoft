ODE XXXVI.
To NUMIDA.

ING, comrades, sing, let incense burn,
And blood of votive heifer flow
Unto the godS, to whom we owe
Our N umida's return Ξ

Warm greetings many wait him here,
From farthest Spain restored, but none
From him return so warm hath won,

As Lamia’S, chiefly dear.

His boyhood's friend, in school and play,
Together manhood’s gown they donned3
Then mark with white, all days beyond,

This most auspicious day.

Bid wine flow fast without control,
And let the dancers' merry feet
The ground in Salian manner beat,

And Bassus drain the bowl

Unbreathed, or own the mastering power
Of Damalis3 and roses fair,
And parsley's vivid green be there,
And lilies of an hour!

F ond looks on Damalis shall be bent,

But sooner shall the ivy be
Torn from its wedded oak, than she
Be from her new love rent.

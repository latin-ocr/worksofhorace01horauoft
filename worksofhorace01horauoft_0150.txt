cxlvi Life of Horace. ’

friend had obviously been a prey to one of his fits of
low spirim, and vexing the kindly soul of the poet ”’ by
gloomy anticipations of an early death. Suffering, as
Maecenas did, from those terrible attacks of sleeplessness
to which he was subject, and which he tried ineffectually
to soothe by the 'plash of falling water and the sound of
distant music‚1 such misgivings were only too natural.
The case was too serious this time 'for Horace to think
of rallying his friend into a· brighter humour. He may
have even seen good cause to share his fears3 sor his
heart is obviously moved to its very depths, and his
sympathy and affection well out in wordS, the pathos of
which is still as fresh as· the day they first came with
comfort to the saddened spirits of Maecenas himself.

“Why wilt thou kin me with thy boding fears ? ‘
Why, oh Maecenas, why?
Before thee lies a train of happy years:

Yes, nor the gods nor Ι
Could brook that thou shouldst first be laid· 1n dust,
Who art my stay, my glory, and my trust 1

Ah l if untimely Fate should snatch thee hence,
Thee, of my soul a part,

Why should I linger on, with deadened sense,
And ever· aching beart,

A worthless fragment of a fallen shrine Ρ

No, no, one day shall see thy death and mine Ξ

Think not that Ι have sworn a bootless oath;
Yes, we shall go, shall go.
- Hand linked in hand, whene'er thou leadest, both
The last sad road below 1
Me neither the Chimaera's fiery breath,
Nor Gyges, even could Gyges rise from death,

1 Had Horace this in his mind when he wrote “Non avium citha-
raeque cantus somnum reducent'’ ?—(Odes, 111. Ι.)

“ Nor song of birds, nor music os the lyre,
shall his lost sleep restore-'²

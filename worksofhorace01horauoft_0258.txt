ODE IV.
To xANTmAS.

L AY, Xanthias, my friend, never blush, man—no, no l
Why should you not love your own maid, if you
please ?
Briseis of old, with her bosom of snow,
Brought the haughty Achilles himself to his kneeS.

By his captive Tecmessa was Telamon's son,
Stout Ajax, to willing captivity tamed ;
Atrides, in triumph, was wholly undone,
With love for the slave'of his war-spear inflamed,

In the hot hour of triumph, when, quelled by the spear
Of Pelides, in heaps the barbarians lay; s

And Troy, with her Hector no longer to sear,
To the war-wearied Greeks fell an easier prey.

For aught that you know, now, fair Phyllis may be
The shoot of some highly respectable stem ;

Nay, she counts, at the least, a few kings in her tree,
And laments the lost acres once lorded by them.

Never think that a creature so exquisite grew
In the haunts where but vice and dishonour are known,
Nor dcem that a girl so unselfish, so true,

Had a mother ’twould shame thee to take for thine own.·'‘·

’θ One fancies the humble object of Phocian Xanthias' admiration
to have been like her who is so exquisitely described by Sir Walter

Scott’s friend in the lines :—

¹¹ Lowly beauty, dear friend, baems with primitive grace,
And 'tis innocence' sels plays the rogue in her face.”

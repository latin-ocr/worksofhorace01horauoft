ODE XII.
'ro AUGUSTUS.

HAT man, what hero, Clio, wilt thou sing,
With lyre or fluting shrill?
What god, whose name shall sportive echo ring
On Helicon's umbrageous hill,
Or Pindus’ steepy erest, or Haemus ever chill?

VVhose groves reeled after OrpheuS, and his song,
Who by its spell could stay

The rushing sweep of streams and tempests strong,
And by his tuneful harpings sway

The listening oaks to move where'er he led the way.

What shall Ι sing before his praise, who reigns
The world’s great sire, and guides
Of men and gods the pleasures and the pains‚
Who rules the land and ocean's tides,
And change of seasons meet for the vast earth provides?

From whom springs none that mightier is than he,
Nor other can we trace‚
Of equal might, or second in degree ;

Yet Panas fills the honoured place
Next to her sire, upraised o'er all the Olympian race.

Nor Bacchus, bold in battle, shall thy farne
My numbers fail to show,
And, virgin huntress of the woods, thy name
In answering strains shall flow,
And thine‚ Apollo, thine‚ god of the unerring bow!

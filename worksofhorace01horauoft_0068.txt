lxiv Life of Horace.

ballads from beginning to end, but could not understand
a line of Shakespeare‚”—no disparagement to Moore,

The Muses of the woods and plains have shed
Their every grace and charm on Virgil’s head.”

follower of his great predecessor. But while he bows to
Lucilius as his master, and owns him superior in polish
and scholarly grace to the satirists who preceded him,

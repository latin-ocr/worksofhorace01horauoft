oon xvn1.] T ο Varus, 3 Ι

Here cups shalt thou sip, 'neath the broad-spreading shade,
Of the innocent vintage of Lesbos at ease, s

No furnes of hot ire shall our banquet invade, (⁷
Or mar that sweet festival under the trees.

And sear not, lest Cyrus, that jealous young bear,
On thy poor little self his rude fingers should set,
Should pluck from thy bright locks the chaplet‚ and tear
Thy dress, that ne’er harmed him nor any one yet.

ODE XVIII.

TO VARUS.

ET the vine, dearest Varus, the vine be the first
of all trees to be planted, of all to be nursed,

On thy well-sheltered acres, round Catilus’ walls,
Where the sun on the green slopes of Tivoli falls ἕ
For to him who ne'er moistens his lip with the grape
Life's every demand wears a terrible shape,
And wine, and wine only, has magic to scare
Despondency’s gloom or the torments of care.
Who’s he that, with wine's joyous fumes in his brain,
Of the travails of war, or of want will complain
Nor rather, sire Bacchus, thy eulogies ebant,
Or thine, Venus, thine, ever beautiful, vaunt?

Yet, that none may be tempted to slight the control
That limits the boon to a temperate bow1,

A warning is set in the wine-kindled strife,
Where the Centaurs and Lapithae grappled for life ;

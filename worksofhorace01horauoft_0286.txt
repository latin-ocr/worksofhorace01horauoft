Even now 1 feel the change begin Ξ
And see, along my thighs

It creeps and creeps, the wrinkling skin,
In sturdy swanlike guise3

My body all above assumes

’ The bird, and white as snow

Along my shoulders airy plumes
Down to my fingers grow.

Now swiftlier borne on pinions bold
Than Icarus of yore,

The Bosphorus shall I behold,
And hear its billows roar:

Shall o'er Getulia's whirling sands,
Canorous bird, career,

And view Hyperborean lands,
From heaven's own azure clear.

My fame the Colchian, and forlorn
Gelonian yet shall know,

The Dacian, too, who seems to scorn,
But dreads his Marsic foe.

The Spaniard of an after time
My minstrel power shall own,

And Ι be hailed a bard sublime
By him that drinks theRhone. ’

Then sing no dirge above my bier,
No grief be idly spent l

Dishonour lies in'e'very tear,
Disgrace in each lament.

All clamours loud of woe sorbeat! ⁴
Respect my nobler doom, ³
And those superfluous honours spate,

Which load a vulgar tomb l

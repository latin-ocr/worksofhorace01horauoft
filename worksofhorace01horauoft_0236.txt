ODE XXVIII.
ARCHYTAS.

SAILOR.

HEE, Ο Archytas, who hast scanned
The wonders of the world by sea and land,
The lack of some few grains
Of scattered dust detains
A shivering phantom here upon Matinum’s strand.
And it avails thee nothing, that thy soul,
Death’s sure-devoted prey,
Soared to the regions of eternal day,
Where wheeling spheres in silvery brightness roll.

ARCHYTAs

What ,then ! E'en Pelops’ sire, the guest
Of godS, to Orcus sank, by death oppressed,
And old Tithonus, too,
Though heavenly air he drew,
And Minos stern, who shared the secrets of Jove's breast.
There, too, Panthoides, once more immured,
Roams, though his spirit's pride
All save this fading flesh to death denied‚
By his old Trojan shield deceitfully assured

And he, even thou wilt grant me, was
Not meanly versed in truth and nature's laws.
But for us all doth stay
One night, and death’s dark way
Must needs be trodden once, howe'er we pause. ’

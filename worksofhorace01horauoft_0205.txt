To Munatius Plancus.

Heart-whole, or pierced by Cupid's sting,
We in our airy way

Of banquets and of maidens sing,

With pared nails coyly skirmishing,
To keep young men at bay.

ODE VII.
To MUNATIUS PLANCUs.

OME will laud fair Mytilene,—
Rhodes, where many wonders be,—
Some great Ephesus, or Corinth
Watered by its double sea ;
Thebes renowned for Bacchus, Delphi
Famous for Apollo’s shrine,
Others praise Thessalian Tempe,
And its thousand charms divine3
Some the towers of spotless Pallas
Chant‚ nor ask another theme,
Thence to pluck an olive garland
All their pride and all their dream.
Many a bard, in Juno's honour,
Makes the burden of his lyre
Rich Mycenae, grassy Argos,
F amous for its steeds ‘of fire.

Me nor patient Lacedemon,
Nor Larissa's fertile plain,
Like Albunea's echoing fountain
All my inmost heart hath ta’en.

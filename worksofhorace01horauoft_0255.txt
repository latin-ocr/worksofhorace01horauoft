ODE III.
To DELLIUS.

ET not the frowns of fate
Disquiet thee, my friend,
Nor, when she smiles on thee, do thou, elate
With vaunting thoughts, ascend
Beyond the limits of becoming rnirffl,
For, Dellius, thou must die, become a clod of earth Η·

Whether thy days go down
In gloom‚ and dull regrets‚
Or, shunning life's vain struggle for renown,
Its severs and its frets‚
Stretched on the grass, with old Falernian wine
Thou giv’st the thoughtless hours a rapture all divine.

Where the tall spreading pine,
And white-leaved poplar grow,
And mingling their broad boughs in leafy twine,

A grateful shadow throw‚
Where down its broken bed the wimpling stream
Writhes on its sinuous way with many a quivering gleam.

Α * “Yet weet ye well, that to a eourage great
It is no lesse beseeming well to beare
The storm of Fortune's frown. or heaven²s threat,
Than in the sunshine of her countenance cleare
Timely to joy, and carrie comely choere.''
-Fairy Quaen, V. v. 38.

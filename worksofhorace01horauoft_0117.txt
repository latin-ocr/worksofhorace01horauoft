Ode to Barine'. cxiii

To thee 'tis gain thy mother’s dust to mock,
To mock the silent wateh·fires os the night,
All heaven, the gods, on whom death's icy shock
Can never light.

Smilcs Venus· sels, 1 vow, to see thy arts,

x The guileless Nymphs and cruel Cupid smile,

And, smiling, whets on bloody stone his darts
Of fire the while.

Nay more. our youth grow up to be thy prey,
New slaves throng round, and those who crouched at first,
Though oft they threaten, leave not for a day
Thy roof accurst.

Thee mothers sor their unfledged younglings dread ;

Thee niggard old men dread, and brides new-made,
In misery, lest their lords neglect their bed,
Ι By thee delayed.''
Horace is more at home in playful raillery of the
ἑ - bewildering effect of love upon otherS, than in giving
expression to its emotions as felt by himself. In the
14th Epode‚ it is true, he begs Maecenas to excuse his
failure to execute some promised poem, because he is
so completely upset by his love for a certain naughty
Phryne that he cannot put a couple oxf lines together.
Again, he tells us (Odes‚ Ι. 19) into what a ferment his
whole being has been thrown, long after he had thought
himself safe from such emotionS‚ by the marble—like sheen
of Glycera's beauty-——her grata protervitas, et voltus nim-

ium lubricus adspici—

“ Her pretty, pert, provoking ways,
And face too fatal-fair to see.’'

The First Ode of the Fourth Book is a beautiful fan-
tasia on a similar theme. He paintS, t00, the tortures of
jealousy with the vigour (odes, Ι. 13> of a man who knew
something of them :—

ODE X.
“ ‘ro A eRUEL BEAUTY.

H, cruel, cruel still,
And yet divinely fair,
When Time with fingers chill
Shall thin the wavy hair,
Which now in many a wanton freak
Around thy shoulders flows,

When fades the bloom, which on thy cheek
Now shames the blushing rose3 Ι

Ah, then as in thy glass

Thou gazest in dismay,
‘ Thou'lt cry, “Alas Ξ 3135 !

Why’feel Ι not to-day‚-

As in my maiden bloom, when I
Unmoved heard lovers moan,

Or, now' that I would win them, why
Is 311 my beauty flown ἢ '²

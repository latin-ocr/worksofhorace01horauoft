ουκ v.] To Pyrrha. 1 1

Thee soon shall night enshroud; and the Manes’ phantom

crowd
And the st'arveling house unbeautiful of Pluto shut thee in 3

And thou shalt not banish care by the ruddy wine-cup there,
Nor woo the gentle Lycidas, whom all are mad to win.

ODE V.
To PYRRHA.

YRRHA, what slender boy, in perfume steeped,
Doth in the shade of some delightful grot
Caress thee now on couch with roses heaped?
For whom dost thou thine amber tresses knot

With all thy seeming-artless grace? Ah me,
How oft will he thy perfidy bewail‚

And j0ys all flown, and shudder at the sea
Rough with the chafing of the blust'rous gale,

’ Who now, fond dreamer, revels in thy charms 3
Who all unweeting how the breezes veer‚
Hopes still to find a welcome in thine arms
As warm as now, and thee as loving-dearl

Ah, woe for those, on whom thy spell is flung
Ι My votive tablet‚ in the temple set,
Proclaims that I to ocean’s god have hung
The vestments in my shipwreck smirched and wet.·’⁵

ἥ “ Then when I shall myself invsafety see,
Α table, for eternal moniment
Of thy great grace. and my great jeopardy,
Great Neptune, 1 avow to hallow unto thee.''

x —Faz‘ry Queen, 111. iv. 10.

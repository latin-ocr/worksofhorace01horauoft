om: xxm] To Vz‘rgz'l. 39

But I am neither lion fell,
Nor tiger grim to work you woe ;
I love you, sweet one, much too well,
Then cling not to your mother so,
But to a lover's tender arms
Confide your ripe ahd rosy charms.

ODE XXIV.
To VIRGIL.

HY should we stem the tears that needs must flow‚
Why blush, that they should freely flow and long,
To think of that dear head in death laid low?
Do thou inspire my melancholy song,
Melpomene, in whom the Muses' sire
Joined with a liquid voice the mastery of the lyre Ξ

And hath the sleep that knows no waking morn
Closed o'er Quinctilius, our Quinctilius dear?

Where shall be found the man of woman born
That in desert might be esteemed his peer,—

Sincere as he, and resolutely just, ¹

So high of heart, and all so absolute of trust?

He sinks into his rest, bewept of many,
And but the good and noble weep for him,
But dearer cause thou, Virgil, hast than any,
With sriendship's tears thy friendless eyes to dim 1
Aias, alas ! Not to such woeful end
Didst thou unto the gods thy prayers unceasing send ἔ

Epistle to M oecenas. clxvii

the exquisite Epistle which forms the Seventh of the First
Book, one that should be read in direct connection with
what has just been said. That Maecenas loved his
friend all the better for it—he could scarcely respect
him more than he seems to have done—from the first—
we may be very sure.

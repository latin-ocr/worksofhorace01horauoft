doubt on that subject in Rome at the time. And if, as
there is every reason to conclude, it was levelled at
Sextus MenaS, the lines, when first shown about among
Horace's friends, must have told with great effect, and
they were likely to be remembered long after the in-
famous career of this double—dyed traitor had come to
a close. Menas was a freedman of Pompey the Great‚
and a trusted officer of his son Sextus.1 He had recently
(B.c. 38) carried over with him to Augustus a portion of
Pompey's fleet which was under his command, and be-
trayed into his hands the islands of Corsica and Sardinia.
For this act of treachery he was loaded with wealth and
honours 3 and when Augustus, next year, fitted out a
naval expedition against Sextus PompeiuS, Menas re-
ceived a command. It was probably lucky for Horace
that this swaggering upstart, who was not likely to be
scrupulous as to his means of revenge, went over the
very next year to his former master, whom he again
abandoned within a year to sell himself once more to
Augustus That astute politician put it out of his power
to play further tricks with the fleet, by giving him a com-
mand in Pannonia, where he was killed, B.c. 36, at the
siege of Siscia, the modern Sissek.

Though Horace was probably best known in Rome in
these early days as a writer of lampoons and satirical
poemS, in which the bitterness of his models Archilo-
chus and Lucilius was aimed at, not very successfully

² Shakespeare has introduced him in “Antony and Cleopatra,”
along with Menecrates and Varrius, as “friends to Sextus Pom·
peius.''

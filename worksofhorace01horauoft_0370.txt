ODE XIV.
To AUGUSTUS. ,

H OW shall the Fathers, how
shall the Quiritians, O Augustus, now,
Intent their honours in no niggard wise
Upon thee to amass,
By storied scroll, or monumental brass
Thy virtues eternise ?

O thou who art, wherever shines the sun

On lands where man a dwelling·place hath won,
Of princes greatest far,

Thee the Vindelici, who ever spumed

Our Latian rule, of late have learned
To know supreme in war l

For 'twas with soldiers thou hadst formed,
That Drusus, greatly resolute,

On many a hard-won field o'erthrew the wild
Genaunians, and the Brenni fleet of soot‚

And all their towering strongholds stormed,
On Alps tremendous piled.

Anon to deadliest fight
The elder Nero pressed,
And, by auspicious omens blessed,
Scattered the giant Rhaetian hordes in flight.
Himself‚ that glorious day,
The foremost in the fray,

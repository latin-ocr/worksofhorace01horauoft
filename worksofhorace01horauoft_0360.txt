168 To Torquatus. [noox w.

Who knows, if they, who all our Fates control,
Will add ἑ. morrow to thy brief to-day? ,
Then think of this—W hat to a friendly soul
Thy hand doth give shall 'scape thine heir's rapacious sway.

When thou, Torquatus, once hast vanished hence,
And o'er thee Minos' great decree is writ,
Nor ancestry‚ nor fite-lipped eloquence‚
Nor all thy store of wealth to give thee back were fit.

For even Diana from the Stygian gloom
Her chaste Hippolytus no more may gain,
And dear Phirithous must 'bide his doom,

For Theseus' arm is frail to rend dark Lethe's chain.

Blows Autumn and his golden fruits away.

Tben melts into the Spring ε Soft Spring, with brath
Favonian, from warm chambers os the south

Recalls the first. All, to reflourish, fades ς

As in a wheel all sinks to reascend.

Emblems of man 'who passes, not expires.”

“ Mark the winds, and mark the skies‚
Ocean's ebb and ooean’s flow ς
Sun and moon but set to rise,

Round and round the saesons g0.’'

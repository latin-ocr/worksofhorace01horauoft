ODE XXX.
'ro MELPOMENE.

I'VE reared a monument, my own,
More durable than brass,
Yea‚ kingly pyramids of stone
In height it doth surpass.

Rain shall not sap, nor driving blast
Disturb its settled base,

Nor countless ages rolling past
Its symmetry deface.

1 shall not wholly die. Some part,
Nor that a little, shall

Escape the dark Destroyer's dart,
And his grim festival.

For long as with his Vestals mute
Rome's Pontifex shall climb

The Capitol, my same shall shoot
Fresh buds through future time.

Where brawls loud Aufidus, and came
Parched Daunus erst, a horde

Of rustic boors to sway‚ my name
Shall be a household word3

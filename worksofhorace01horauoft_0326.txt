And put such conrage in the brain,
As makes the poor be men again,
Whom neither tyrants' wrath affrights,
Nor all their bristling satellites.

Bacchus, and Venus, so that she
Bring only frank festivity,
With sister Graces in her train,
Twining close in lovely chain, ⁵
And gladsome tapers' living light,
Shall spread your treasures o'er the night,
Till Phoebus the red East unbars,
And puts to rout the trembling stars.·

TO DIANA.

AIL, guardian maid
Of mount and forest glade‚
Who, thrice involfed, dost bow
Thine ear, and sendest aid
To girls in labour with the womb,
And snatchest them from an untimely tomb‚
Goddess three-formed thou 1

I consecrate as thine
This overhanging pine,
My villa's shade ; ι
There, as my years decline,
The blood of boar so young, that he

Dreams only yet of sidelong strokes‚ by me
Shall joyfully be paid!

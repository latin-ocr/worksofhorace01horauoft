cxxxiv Life of Horace.

Your side unwrung by spasm or stitch,
Your foot unconscious of a twitch3

And could you be more truly blest,
Though of the wealth of kings possessed ἲ ”

It must have been pleasant to Horace to find even
one among his friends illustrating in his life this modest
Socratic creed 3 for he is so constantly enforcing it, in
every variety of phrase and metaphor, that while we must
conclude that he regarded it as the one doctrine most
needful for his time, we must equally conclude that he ,
found it utterly disregarded. All round him wealth‚
wealth‚ wealth‚ was the universal aim: wealth‚ to build
fine houses in town, and villas at Praeneste or Baiae3
wealth‚ to stock them with statueS‚ old bronzes (mostly
fabrications from the Wardour Streets of Athens or
Rome), ivories‚ pictureS, gold plate, pottery‚ tapestry‚
stuffs from the looms of Tyre, and other articles de luxe,·
wealth‚ to give gorgeous dinnerS, and wash them down
with the costliest wines; wealth‚ to provide splendid
equipageS, to forestall the front seats in the theatre‚ as
we do opera—boxes on the grand tier, ancl so get a few
yards nearer to the emperor's chair‚ or gain a closer view
of the favourite actor or dancer of the day ς wealth‚ to
secure a wife with a fortune and a pedigree 3 wealth to
attract gadfly friendS, who will consume your time, eat
your dinnerS, drink your wines‚ and then abuse them,
and who will with amiable candour regale their circle by
quizzing your foibleS‚ or slandering your! taste, if they
are even so kind as to spare your character. “Gold,
sovereign gold,'' he says (Epistles, Ι. 6),

“ Bn'ngs friends, birth, beauty, power,
Credit, a wife—a wife, too, with a dower.

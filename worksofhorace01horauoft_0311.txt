LYDIA.

Though lovelier than yon star is he,
Thou fickle as an April sky,

More churlish‚ too, than Adria's sea,
With thee I'd live, with thee I'd die!

ODE X.
To LYC'E.

HOUGH your drink were the Tanais, chillest of rivers,
And your lot with some conjugal savage were cast,
You would pity, sweet Lyce, the poor soul that shivers
Out here at your door in the merciless blast.

Only hark how the doorway goes straining and creaking,
‘And the piercing wind pipes through the trees that surround
The court of your villa, while black frost is streaking
With ice the crisp snow that lies thick on the ground!

In your pride—Venus hates it—no longer envelop ye,
Or haply you'll find yourself laid on the shelf;

You never were made sor a prudish Penelope,
’Tis not in the blood of your sires or yourself.

Though nor gifts nor entreaties can win a sost answer,
Nor the violet pale of my love-ravaged cheek,

Though your husband be false with a Greek ballet-dancer,
And you still are true, and forgiving, and meek‚

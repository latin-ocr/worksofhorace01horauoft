xciv sze of Horace.

Don’t talk to me of taste, Ofellus continues-

‘¹ Will it give you a notion,
If this pike in the Tiber was caught, or the ocean?
If it used 'twixt the bridges to glide and to quiver,
Or was tossed to and fro at the mouth of the river? '⁹

Just as our epicures profess to distinguish by flavour a
salmon fresh run from the sea from one that has been
degenerating for four-and-twenty hours in the fresh water
of the river—with this difference, however, that, unlike
the salmon with uS, the above-bridge pike was consid-
ered at Rome to be more delicate than his sea—bred and
leaner brother.

Ofellus next proceeds to ridicule the taste which prizes
what is set before it for mere size, or rarity‚ or eost. It is
this, he contendS, and not any exceHence in the things
themselveS, which makes people load their tables with the
sturgeon or the stork. Fashion, not flavour, prescribes
the rule 3 indeed, the more perverted her wayS, the
more sure they are to be followed.

‘⁴ So were any one now to assure us a treat
In cormorants roasted, as tender and sweet.
The young men of Rome are so prone to what's wrong,
They’d eat cormorants all to a man, before long.”

But, continues Ofellus, though I would have you frugal,
I would not have you mean—

“ One vicious extreme it is idle to shun,
If into its opposite straightway you run ; ”

sketches which give a distinctive life to Horace's
Satires,

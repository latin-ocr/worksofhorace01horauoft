166 In Praise of Apollo and Diana. [noox ιν.

O beardless Agyieus, uphold, 1 implore,

The fame of the Daunian Muse evermore,

For 'twas thou didst inspire me with poesy's flame‚
Thou gav'st me the art of the bard, and his name!

ν Ye virgins, the foremost in rank and in race,

Ye boys, who the fame of your ancestry grace,
Fair wards of the Delian goddess, whose bow
Lays the swift-footed lynx and the antelope low,
To the Lesbian measure keep time with your feet,
And sing in accord with my thumb in its beat3
Hymn the son of Latona in cadence aright,

Hymn duly the still-waxing lamp of the night,
That with plentiful fruitage the season doth cheer,
And speeds the swist months on to girdle the year!

And thou, who art chief of the' chorus to-day,
Soon borne home a bride in thy beauty shalt say,
“ When the cyclical year brought its festival days,
My voice led the hymn of thanksgiving and praise,
So sweet‚ the Immortals to hear it were fain,
And 'twas Horace the poet who taught me the strain2''

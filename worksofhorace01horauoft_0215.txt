onr, xu.] T 0 Augustus. 2 3

With growth occult expands, like lusty tree,
The young Marcellus' farne :³⁶
The Julian star's serene resplendency
All other stars doth shame,
As quells the lesser fires the Moon's triumphant flame.

Thou sire and guardian of all human kind,
Saturnian Jove, to thee

The care of mighty Caesar was assigned
By destiny, and he

Next to thyself in power our sovereign lord shall be.

Whether he quell the Parthian threatening spoil
To Latium' sons, and lead

The foe, that would insult our natal soil,
In triumph‚-or the Mede

Subdue‚ and other foeS‚ the distant Ind doth breed

Next under thee, his righteous hand shall make
The world his rule obey;
’ Olympus thou with thy dread car shalt shake,
Thou shalt thy bolts array
Against the grove5‚ wherein foul orgies shrink from day.

⁴* So the Bishop of Ely‚ speaking of the development in King Henry
V. of the powers and virtues, which had never been surmised in Prince

Hal, says :—

⁸⁴ The prince obscured his contemplation
Under the veil of wildness ; which, no doubt,
Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
Unseen, yet crescive in itssaculty.¹·
-Hemy V.. Aet 1. Sc. 1.

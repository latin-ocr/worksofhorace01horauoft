Though ost they threaten, leave not for a day

Thee mothers for their unfledged younglings dread ;

Thy roof accurst.

73

Thee niggard old men dread, and brides new-made,
ln misery lest their lords neglect their bed,

By thee delayed.

ODE IX.
To VALGIUS.

N OT always from the clouds are rains
Descending on the oozy plains‚

Not always o’er the Caspian deep

Do gusts of angry tempest sweep,

Nor mouth on mouth, the long year through,

Dear Valgius, valued friend and true,
Is frost's benumbing mantle round
The high lands of Armenia wound;
Not always groan Garganus' oaks
Before the north wind's furious strokes,
Nor is the ash-tree always seen,
Stript of its garniture of green3

Yet thou alway in strains forlorn

Thy Mystes dead dost fondly mourn,
Lamenting still at Hesper’s rise,

And when the rapid sun he flies.

Remember, friend, that sage old man,
Whose years were thrice our common span,

With ruin and disaster fraught x
To after times, should they be taught j
Another creed than this-“ They die '²
Unwept, who brook captivity 1 ''

“ I've seen,'' he cried, “our standards hung
In Punic sanes, our weapons wrung
From Roman hands without a blow;
Our citizens, I’ve ‘seen them go,
With arms behind their free backs fied,
Gates I have seen flung open wide,
Ay, Roman troops I've seen,-disgraced
To till the plains they had laid waste !

“ Will he return more brave and bold,
The soldier you redeem with gold? ⁵
You add but loss unto disgrace.

Its native whiteness once efface

With curious dyes3 you can no more
That whiteness to the wool restore: v
Nor is true valour, once debased‚

In souls corrupt to be replaced!

“ If from the tangled meshes freed,
The stag will battle, then indeed
May he conspicuous valour show,
Who trusted the perfidious foe,—
He smite upon some future field
The Carthaginian, who could yield,
In sear os death, his arms to be
Bound up with thongs submissively!
Content to draw his caitiff breath,
Nor feel such life is worse than death!
O shame Σ O mighty Carthage, thou
On Rome's fallen glories towerest now !'’

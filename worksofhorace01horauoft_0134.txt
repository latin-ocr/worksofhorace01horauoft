cxxx Life 'of Horace.

Tibur, with its “ sylvan shadeS, and orchards moist with
wimpling rills,''—the “Tiburni lucus et uda mobilibus
pomaria rivt'sJ'—and its milder climate, so genial to his
sun-loving temperament.

“ Septimius, thou who wouldst‚ Ι know,
With me to distant Gades go,
And visit the Cantabrian fell,
Whom all our triumphs cannot quell,
And even the sands barbarian brave,
Where ceaseless seethes the Moorish wave;

May Tibur, that delightful haunt,
Reared by an Argive emigrant,
The tranquil haven be, Ι pray‚
For my old age to wear away3
Oh, may it be the final boume
To one with war and travel worn l

But should the eruel fates decree

That this, my friend, shall never be,

Then to Galaesus, river sweet

To skin-clad flocks, will Ι retreat,

And those rich meads, where sway os yore
Laconian Phalanthus bore.

In all the world no spot there is,
That wears for me a smile like this,
The honey of whose thymy fields
May vie with what Hymettus yields,
Where berries clustering every slope
May with Venafrum's greenest eope.

There Jove accords a lengthened spring,
And winters wanting winter’s sting,
And sunny Aulon’s 1 broad incline

Such mettle puts into the vine,

Its clusters need not envy those

Which fiery Falernum grows,

² Galaesus (Galaso), a river ; Aulon, a hill near Tarentum.

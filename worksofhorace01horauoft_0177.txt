The Secular Hymn. clxxiii

Doctors prescribe, who understand the mles,

And only workmen handle workmen's tools 3

But literate and illiterate‚ those who can,

And those who cannot, now write verses to a man.''

Or, as Pope with a finer emphasis translates his words-—

“ But those who cannot write, and those who can,
All rhyme, and scrawl, and scribble to a man.'’

It was very well for Horace to laugh at his own inability
to abstain from verse-making, but, had he been ever so
much inclined to silence, his friends would not have let
him rest. Some wanted an Ode, some an Epode, some
a Satire (Epistle5‚ II. 2)—

“ Three hungry guests sor different dishes call,
And how’s one host to satisfy them all? '’

—(Coningt0n.)

And there was one friend, whose request it was not easy
to deny. This was Augustus, Ten years after the im-
perial power had been placed in his hands (13.0. 17) he
resolved to celebrate a great national festival in honour
of his own successful career. Horace was called on to
write an Ode, known in his works as the “Secular
Hymn,” to be sung upon the occasion by twenty-seven
boys and twenty-seven girls of noble birth. “ The Ode,'’
says Macleane, “was sung at the most solemn part of the
festival, while the Emperor was in person offering sacri-
fice at the second hour of the night, on the river-side,
upon three altarS, attended by the fifteen men who pre-
sided over religious affairs. The effect must have been

‡ very beautiful, and no wonder if the impression on Hor-

ace's feelings was strong and lasting.'' He was obviously

pleased at being chosen for the task, and not without

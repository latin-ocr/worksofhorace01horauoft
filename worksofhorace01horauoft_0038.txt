xxxiv sze of Horace.

—for bitterness and personal rancour were not natural
to the man—he showed in other compositions signs of
the true poetic spirit, which afterwards found expres·
sion in the consummate grace and finish of his Odes. “
To this class belongs the 16th Epode, which, from
internal evidence, appears to have been written B.C.
40, when the state of Italy, convulsed by civil war,
was well calculated to fill him with despair, Horace
had, frequent occasion between this period and the
battle of Actium, when the defeat and death of Antony
closed the long struggle for supremacy between him and
OctaviuS, to appeal to his countrymen against the waste
of the best blood of Italy in civil fray, which might have
been better spent in subduing a foreign foe, and spread-
ing the lustre of the Roman arms· But if we are to sup-
pose this poem written when the tidings of the bloody
incidents of the Perusian campaign had arrived in Rome,
-the reduction of the town of Perusia by famine, and
the massacre of from two to three hundred prisonerS,
almost all of equestrian or senatorial rank,—we can well
understand the strong feeling by which it is pervaded.

To THE ROMAN PEOPLE.

“ Another age in civil wars will soon be spent and worn.
And by her native strength our Rome be wrecked and overborne,
That Rome, the Marsians could not crush, who border on our lands‚
Nor the shock of threatening Porsena with his Etruscan hands,
Nor Capua's strength that rivalled ours, nor Spartacus the stem,
Nor the faithless Allobrogian, who still for change doth yaern.
Ay, what Germania's blue·eyed youth quelled not with ruthless sword‚
Nor Hannibal by our great sires detested and abhorred,
We shall destroy with impious hands imbrued in brothers gore,
And wild beasts of the wood shall range our native land once more.
A foreign foe, alas ἱ shall tread The City's ashes down,
And his horse's ringing hoofs shall smite her places of renown,

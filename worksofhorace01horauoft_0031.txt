His Earlz‘est Satira. xxvii

, PersiuS‚ a rich trader of Clazomene‚ has a lawsuit with
Rupilius, one of Brutus's officerS‚ who went by the nick-
name of “ King.'' BrutuS, in his character of quaestor,
has to decide the dispute, which in the hands of the
principals degenerateS, as disputes so conducted gener-
ally do, into a personal squabble. Persius leads off with
some oriental flattery of the general and his suite.
Brutus is “Asia's sun‚'' and they the “ propitious starS,''
all but Rupilius, who was

‘⁴ Tha pest,
The Dog, whom husbandmen detest.”

Rupilim, an old hand at slang, replies with a volley of
rough sarcasmS, “ such as among the vineyards fly‚'' and

‘⁸ Would make the passer-by
Shout filthy nameS, but shouting fly'’-

a description of vintage slang which is as true to-day as
it was then. The conclusion is curiouS, as a punning
allusion to the hereditary fame of Brutus as a puller-
down of kingS, which it must have required some
courage to publish‚ when Augustus was omnipotent
in Rome.

“ But Grecian Persius, after he
Had been besprinkled plenteously
With gall Italic, eries, ‘ By all
The gods above, on thee 1 call,
O Brutus, thou of old renown,
For putting kings completely down.
To save us ! Wherefore do you not
Despatch this King here on the spot Ρ
One of the tasks is this, believe,
Which you are destined to achieve !'''

Εἰς just such a squib as a young fellow might be

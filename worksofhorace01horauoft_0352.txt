160 Tlce Praises os Drusus, [Boon w.

Whence came their custom—in the night
Of farthest time it flourished there-—
With Amazonian axe to fight,
To question I sorbear ;
Nor anything to know, may any mortal dare3

But this I know; their hosts, that stin,
Where’er they came, victorious fought,
In turn by that young hero's skill
Revanquished, have been taught
To feel what marvels may of enterprise be wrought

By valiant heart and vigorous head,
In home auspicious trained to power,
What by the noble spirit fed
In Nero's sons by our
Augustus, who on them a father's care did shower.

’Tis of the brave and good alone
That good and brave men are the seed ; ’κ
The virtues, which their sires have shown,
Are found in steer and steed;
Nor do the eagles fierce the gentle ringdove breed.

Yet training quickens power inborn,
And culture nerves the soul sor fame;
But he must live a lise of scorn,
Who bears a noble name,
Yet blurs it with the soil of infamy and shame.

What thou, Rome, dost the N eros owe,
Let dark Metaurus' river say,

ὅ ” Ο worthiness of nature, breed of greatness!
Cowards father cowards‚ and base things the base.''
—Cymbelc'ne.

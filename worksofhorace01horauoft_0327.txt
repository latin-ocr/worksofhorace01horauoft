ODE XXIII.
To PmDrLE.

F thou, at each new moon, thine upturned palms,
My rustic Phidyle, to heaven shalt list,
The Lares soothe with steam of fragrant balms,
A sow, and fruits new-plucked‚ thy simple gift;

Nor venomed blast shall nip thy fertile vine,
Nor mildew blight thy harvest in the ear3

Nor shall thy flocks, sweet nurselings, peak and pine,
When apple-bearing Autumn chills the year.

The victim marked for sacrifice, that feeds
On snow-capped Algidus, in leafy lane
of oak and ilex, or on Alba's meads,
With its rich blood the pontifPs axe may stain ;

Thy little gods for humbler tribute call ’ ⁴
Than blood of many victims; twine for them
Of rosemary a simple coronal,

And the lush myrtle's frail and fragrant stem.

The costliest sacrifice that wealth can make
From the incensed Penates less commands

A soft response, than doth the poorest cake‚ —
1f on the altar laid with spotless hands.

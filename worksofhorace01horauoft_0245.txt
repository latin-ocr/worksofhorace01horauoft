oms xxxv-,1 To Fortune. 53

T hee Hope attend, and Truth rare-seen,
In vestments snowy-dyed‚

No,r quit thee, though in changed array

Thou turn with angry frown away
From halls of stately pride.

But the unfaithful harlot herd
Slink back. Howe'er they cling,
Once to the lees the wine-vat drain,
And shrinking from the yoke of pain,
These summer friends take wing!⁴

Our Caesar's way to Britain guard,
Earth's farthest boundary,

And make our youthful hosts thy care,

Who terror to the East shall bear,
And the far Indian sea Ξ

By brothers’ blows, by brothers’ blood,
Our souls are gashed and stained.

Alas ! What horror have we fied?-
What crime not wrought? When bath the dread
Of heav'n our youth restrained?

Where is the altar unprofaned

By them? Oh may we see
Thy hand new-whet their blunted swordS,
To smite Arabia’s tented hordes,

And the Massagetae Ε

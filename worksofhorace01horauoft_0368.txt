176 To V z‘rgil. [Boox 1v.

And thirst‚ Ο my Virgil, comes in with the season3
But if you'd have wine from the Calian press,

You must lure it from me by some nard,—and with reason,—
Thou favourite bard of our youthful noblesse.

Yes, a small box of nard from the stores of Sulpicius
A cask shall elicit, of potency rare

To endow with fresh hopes, dewy-bright and delicious‚
And wash from our hearts everyaeobweb of care.

If you'd dip in such joyS, come—the better, the quicker 3—
But remember the see—for it suits not my ends,

To let you make haVOC, scot-free, with my liquor,
As though I were one of your heavy-pursed friends.

To the winds with base lucre and pale melancholy !-—
In the flames of the pyre these, alas Ξ will be vain,

Mix your sage ruminations with glimpses of fo·lly,—
'Tis delightful at times to be somewhat insane!

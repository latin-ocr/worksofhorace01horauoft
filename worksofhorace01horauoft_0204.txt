ODE V1.

To AGRIPPA.

ΒΥ Varius shall thy prowess be
In strains Maeonic chanted,

The victories by land and sea,

Our gallant troops, led on by thee,
Have won with swords undaunted.

Such themes, Agrippa, never hath
My lyre essayed, nor bold
Pelides' unrelenting wrath,
Nor artfullest Ulysses' path
O'er oceans manifold 3

Nor woes of Pelops’ fated line 3
Such flights too soaring are!

Nor doth my bashful Muse incline,

Great Caesar's eulogies and thine
With its thin notes to mars*

Who, who shall sing, with accents just,
Mars’ adamantino mail,

Or Merion, grimed with Trojan dust,

Or him who, strong in Pallas’ trust,
Made even Immortals quail?

⁴⁶ ‘⁸ Ο sovereign queen, whose praise 1 would indite,
Indite I would as duty doth excite ;
But ah! my rhymes too rude and rugged are·
When.in so high an obJect they do light,
And, striving fit to make, I sear do mar.”
—Fairy Queen, 111. ii. 3.

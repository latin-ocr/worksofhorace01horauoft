cxxxvi Life of Horace.

point the minds of men 3 but he presses strongly home
their folly‚ in so far as this world is concerned. To what
good, he asks, all this turmoil and disquiet? No man
truly possesses more than he is able thoroughly to enjoy.
Grant that you roll in gold, or, by accumulating land,
become, in Hamlet's phrase, “ spacious in the possession
of dirt.'’ What pleasure will you extract from these, which
a moderate estate will not yield in equal, if not greater,
measure? You fret yourself to acquire your wealth—
you fret yourself lest you should lose it. It robs you of
your health‚ your ease of mind, your freedom of thought
and action. Riches will not bribe inexorable death to
spare you. At any hour that great leveller may sweep
you away into darkness and dust, and what will it then
avail you, that you have wasted all your hours, and fore-
gone all wholesome pleasure, in adding ingot to ingot, or
acre to acre, for your heirs to squander? Set a bound,
then, to your desires ε think not of how much others have,
but of how much which they have you can do perfectly
well without. Be not the slave of show or circumstance,
“but in yourself possess your own desire.’' Do not lose
the present in vain perplexities about the future. If for-
tune lours to-day, she may smile to·morr0w 3 and when
she lavishes her gifts upon you, cherish an humble heart,
and so fortify yourself against her caprice. Keep a rein
upon all your passions—upon covetousness above all 3
for once that has you within its clutch‚ farewell for ever
to the light heart and the sleep that comes unbidden, to
the open eye that drinks in delight from the beauty and
freshness and infinite variety of nature, to the unclouded
mind that judges justly and serenely of men and things,

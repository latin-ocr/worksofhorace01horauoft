oDE XXIX
TO ICCIUS.

O, Icciu5‚ thou hast hankerings
For swart Arabia’s golden treasure5‚
And for her still unconquered kings
Art marshalling war's deadly measures,
And forging setters meant to tame
The Mede, our curse and shame?

Say, what barbarian virgin fair
Shall wait on thee, that slew her lover,
What princely boy‚ with perfumed hair,
Thy cupbearer, shall round thee hover,
Schooled by his sire, with fatal craft
To wing the Seric shast?

Up mountains steep may glide the brooks,
And Tiber to its sources roam,

When thou canst change thy noble books
Culled far and near, and learned home,

For armour dipped in Ebro’s wave,

Who once such promise gave!

106 .To Calliope. [BOOK 111.

Strewn by th‘e storied doves ; and wonder fell
On all, their nest who keep
On Acherontia's steep,

Or in Forentum's low rich pastures dwell,
Or Bantine woodlands deep;

That safe from bears and adders in such place
I lay, and slumbering smiled,
O’erstrewn with myrtle wilcl

And laurel, by the gods’ peculiar grace
No craven-hearted child.

Yours am 1, O ye Muses, yours, whene’er
The Sabine peaks Ι scale ;
Or cool Praeneste's vale,

Or Tibur's slopes‚ or Baiae's·waters fair
With happy heart Ι hail.

Unto your dances and your fountains vowed‚
Philippi's rout, the tree
Of doom o’erwhelmed not me,

Nor Palinurusfmid the breakers loud
Of the Sicilian sea.

Unshrinkingly, so you be only near,
The Bosphorus I'll brave,
Nor quail, howe’er it rave,

Assyria’s burning sands I'll dare, nor fear
In them to find a grave.

Shielded by you, I'll visit Britain’s shore
To strangers ruthless ever,
Front the Gelonian quiver,

The Concan, t00, who joys in horses' gore,
And Scythia's icy river.

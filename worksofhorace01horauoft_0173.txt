Horace's Healtlz Delz‘cale. clxix

Which place is best supplied with corn, d'ye think?

Have they rain-water or fresh springs to drink?

Their wines 1 care not for ; when at my farm

I can drink any sort without much harm;

But at the sea Ι need a generous kind

To warm my veins‚ and pass into my mind,

Enrich me with new hopes, choice words supply,

And make me comely in a lady's eye.

Which tract is best for game? on which sea-coast

Urchins and other fish abound the most?

That so, when Ι return, my friends may see

A sleek Phaeacian 1 come to life in-me :

These things you needs must tell me, Vala dear,

And 1 no less must act on what 1 hear.”
—(Conington.)

Valetudinarian though he waS, Horace maintains, in his
later as in his early writingS, a uniform cheerfulneSS.
This never forsakes him 3 for life is a boon for which he
is ever grateful. The gods have allotted him an ample
share of the means of enjoyment‚ and it is his own fault if
he suffers sels-created worries or desires to vex him. By
the questions he puts to a friend in one of the latest of
his Epistles (II. 2), we see what was the ‘discipline he
applied to himself :—

⁴¹ You're not a miser: has all other vice
Departed in the train of avarice?
Or do ambitious longings‚ angry fret,
The terror of the grave, torment you yet?
Can you make sport of portents, gipsy crones,
Hobgoblins, dreams, raw head and bloody bones?
Do you count up your birthdays year by year,
And thank the gods with gladness and blithe cheer,
O’erlook the failings of your friends, and grow

Gentler and better as your sand runs low Ρ ”
-(Conington.)

And to this⁶beautifu1 catalogue of what should be a good

1 The Phaeacians were proverbially fond of good living.

T O Asinius Pollio. [Boon ιι.

Now, now our ears you pierce
With clarions shrill, and trumpets' threatenings fieree,
Now flashing arms affright
Horses and riders‚ scattering both in ssight;
Now do I seem to hear
The shouting of the mighty leaders near,
And see them strike and thrust‚
Begrimed with not unhonourable dust ;
And all earth own control,
All, all save only Cato's unrelenting soul!

Juno, and whosoe'er

Among the gods made Afric’s sons their care,
On that same soil, which they,

Of vengeance foiled‚ had turned from in dismay,
Under Jugurtha's shade

His victor's grandsons as an offering paid.
Where is the plain, that by

Its mounds sepulchral doth not testify
To many an impious fray,

VVhere Latian blood made fat the yielding clay,
And to fell havoc's sound

Pealed from the west to Media‘s farthest bound?
What bayS, what rivers are

By ius unvisited of woful war?
What oceans by the tide

Of slaughter rolling red'have not been dyed?
VVhere shall be found the shore,

Is not incarnadined >by Roman gore?

But, froward Muse, restain,
Affect not thou the elegiae strain!
With lighter touch essay
Ι n Dionaean cave with me some sprightlier lay!

T 0 Augustus, [Βοοκ IV. ξ

No more adulterers stain our beds,
Laws, morals, both that taint efface,
The husband in the child we trace‚

And close on crime sure vengeance treads.

The Parthian, under Caesar's reign,
Or iey Scythian‚ who can dread,
Or all the tribes barbarian bred

By Germany, or ruthless Spain?

Now each man, basking on his slopes,
Weds to his widowed trees the vine,
Then, as he gaily quaffs his wine,

Salutes thee God of all his hopes;

And prayers to thee devoutly sends,
With deep libations; and, as Greece
Ranks Castor, and great Hercules,

Thy godship with his Lares blends.

Oh, mayst thou on Hesperia shine,
Her chief, her joy, for many a day!
Thus, dry-lipped, thus at morn we pray,
Thus pray at eve, when'flushed with wine.

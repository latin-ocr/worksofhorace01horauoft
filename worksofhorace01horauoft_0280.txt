ODE xvnT
TO MAECENAS.

'x HY wilt thou kill me with thy boding fears?
Why, Ο Maecenas, why?
Before thee lies a train of happy years;
Yes, nor the gods nor Ι
Could brook that thou shouldst first be laid in dust
Who art my stay, my glory, and my trust Ξ

Ah, if untimely Fate should snatch thee hence.
Thee, of my soul a part,

Why should 1 linger on, with deadened sense,
And ever-aching beart,

A worthless fragment of a fallen shrine?

No, no, one day shall see thy death and mine!

Think not, that I have sworn a bootless oath;
Yes, we shall go, shall go,

Hand linked in hand, whene'er thou leadest, both
The last sad road below!

Me neither the Chimaera’s fiery breath,

Nor Gyges, even could Gyges rise from death,

With all his hundred hands from thee shall sever ;
For in such sort it hath

Pleased the dread FateS, and Justice potent ever,
To interweave our path.

Beneath whatever aspect thou wert born,

Libra, or Scorpion fierce, or Capricorn,

.Pr0pleetic Ode. cxlvii

· With all his hundred hands from thee shall sever;

For in such sort it hath

Pleased the dread Fates, and Justice potent ever,
To interweave our path.1

Beneath whatever aspect thou wert born,

Libra, or Scorpion fierce, or Capricorn,

The blustering tyrant of the western deep,
This well Ι know, my friend,

Our stars in wondrous wise one orbit keep,
And in one radiance blend.

From thee were Saturn’s baleful rays afar

Averted by great Jove’s refulgent star,

And His hand stayed Fate's downward-swooping wing‚
When thrice with glad acclaim

The teeming theatre was heard to ring,
And thine the honoured name τ

So had the falling timber laid me low,
But Pan in mercy warded off the blow,

Pan who keeps watch o'er easy souls like mine.
Remember, then, to rear

In gratitude to Jove a votive shrine,
And slaughter many a steer‚

Whilst 1, as fits, an humbler tribute pay,

And a meek lamb upon his altar lay.''

What the poet, in this burst of loving sympathy, said
would happen, did happen almost as he foretold it.
Maecenas “first deceased ;'' and Horace, like the wife
in the quaint, tendet, old epitaph,

¹¹ For a little tried
To live without him, liked it not, and died .''

But this was not till many years after this Ode was
written, which it must have been about the year 13.c. 36,
when Horace was thirty-nine. Maecenas lived for seven-

¹ So Cowley, in his poem on the death of Mr William Harvey 3-

“ He was my friend, the tmest friend on earth ;
Α strong and mighty influence joined our birth. ”

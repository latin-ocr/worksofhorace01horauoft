ODE V.
THE PRA1SE OF VALOUR.

WHEN through the heavens his thunders blare,
We think that Jove is monarch there,

So now AugustuS, too, shall be

Esteemed a present deity,

Since Britons he and Persians dread

Hath to his empire subjected„

Has any legionary, who

His falchion under Crassus drew,

A bride barbarian stooped to wed,

And life with her ignobly led?

And can there be the man so base

Of Marsian or Apulian race,

(Oh, on the Senate be the blame Ξ

Oh, on our tainted morals shame Σ)

As with his spouse's sire, his foe, ’

And in a soeman’s camp, to grow

To age beneath some Median king,

The shields no more remembering‚

Nor yet the Roman dress or name,

Nor Vesta’s never-dying flame,

Whilst still unscathed stands Jove, and Rome,

Ὁ His city, and his only horne?

. Ab, well he feared such shame for us,
he brave, sar-seeing Regulus,

When he the vile conditions spurned‚

That might to precedent be turned,

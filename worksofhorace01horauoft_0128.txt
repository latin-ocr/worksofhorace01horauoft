cxxiv [Αἶα of Horace.

Remember fond Phaethon’s fiery sequel,
And heavenward-aspiring Bellerophon's fate ;
And pine not sor one who would ne’er be your equal,
But level your hopes to a lowlier mate.
So, come, my own Phyllis, my heart's latest treasure—
For ne’er for another this bosom shall long—-
And I'll teach‚ while your loved voice re-echoes the measure,
How to charm away care with the magic of song.''

This is very pretty and picturesque 3 land Maecenas was
sure to be charmed with it as a birthday ode, for such it

ἲ certainly waS, whether there was any real Phyllis in the

case or not. Most probably there was not,-—-the allusion
to Telephus, the lady-killer‚ is so very like many other
allusions of the same kind in other odeS, which are
plainly mere exercises of fancy, and the protestation that
the lady is the very, very last of his loveS, so precisely
what all middle-aged gentlemen think it right to say,
whose jeunessa like' the poet'5‚ has been notoriously
orageuse.1

1 When these ‚views were first published (1870), my friend the late
W. G. Clark, Public Orator of Cambridge—a man whose knowledge
of the world, no less than his fine scholarship. gave special value
to his opinion—wrote to me: “ I go with you thoroughly in your
general conclusions, but Ι cannot bring myself to believe as firmly as
you do in the reality of his Lydias, Cinaras, and Lalages. 11· we had
the whole mass of Greek lyrie poetry before uS, we should probably find
that Horace had cleverly imitated, or even translated, in many odes
which now seem to us to be original. 1 think that Horace's contempo-
raries would take quite as much pleasure in a successful imitation os an
old Greek favourite as in an original poem, and find the same charm in
such imitations as our fathers found in ‘ London' and ‘The Vanity of
Human Wishes.’ The characteristic traits of Hora‘ce's women are, to
my mind, wanting in individuality, 'and are such as belong to ‘devia
scorta’ in all ages and countries. ⁴ Beshrew me' if Ι believe in the
existence of one of them, except the ‘mendax puella· who failed in her·
appointment on the road to Brundusium.”

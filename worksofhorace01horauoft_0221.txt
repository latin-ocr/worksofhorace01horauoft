ODE XVI.

TO TYNDARIS.

THOU, than thy beautiful mother that still
More beautiful art, for all men to admire,
My scurrilous verses destroy how you will,
Deep drown thern in ocean, or quench thern in fire 1

Dindymene herself, nor the Pythian, when

He convulses his priests with the fury prophetie,
Nor Bacchus, nor Corybants„ clashing again

And again their wild cymbals‚ such fervour phrenetic

Can move as fell rage ; which no terrors can tame,
N either Norican glaive, nor the ocean bestrewed
With wreck and disaster, nor merciless flame,
Nor the thunders of Jove in his vengefullest mood.

’Tis the curse of our birth 3 for Prometheus, they say,
Compelled from all beasts some particular part

To select for his work, to our primitive clay
Imparted the lion's impetuous heart.

Rage drew on Thyestes the vengeance of heaven,
Through rage have been levelled the lostiest halls
And cities high-famous, and ploughshares been driven

By insolent enemies over their walls.

But rest thee at ease Ξ In youth's pleasant spring-time
The shafts of my passion at random 1 flung,

And dashing headlong into petulant rhyrne
I recked neither where nor how fiercely I stung.

clxxii Life of Horace.

IessonS,—-verbaque et voces,—for his soothing or invigor-
ating balsamS‚ as much as though this gifted physician
of soul and body had compounded them specially for
ourselveS.''

When he published the First Book of Epistles he
seems to have thought the time come for him to write
no more lyrics (Epistles, Ι. 1) :—

¹⁸ So verses now and all such toys 1 quit,
And toil my best to find the true and fit.”

Graver habits, and a growing fastidiousness of taste, were
likely to give rise to this feeling. But a poet can no
more renounce his lyre than a painter his palette 3 and
his fine “ Secular Hymn,'' and many of the Odes of the
Fourth Book, which were written after this period, prove
that, so far from suffering any decay in poetical power,
he had even gained in force and originality of conception,
and in that curiosa filicitas, that exquisite felicity of ex-
pression, which has been justly ascribed to him by Pe-
tronius. Several years afterwards, when writing of the
mania for scribbling verse which had beset the Romam,
as if, like Dogberry's reading and writing, the faculty of
writing poetry came by nature, he alludes to his own

sins in the same direction with a touch of his old irony
(EpistleS, II. 1) :—

“ Even 1, who vow Ι never write a line,
The Parthians in mendacity outshine,
Awake before the sun is up, and call
For pen and parchment, writing-case and au.
Where is the man will undertake to steer,
Who's strange to ships, and all their sailing gear?
Who ventures to administer a draught,
Without due training in the doctor’s craft ?

· of his splendour. Again, in one of his Odes to Maecenas

(III. 16> he takes up and expands the same theme.

‘⁸ In my crystal stream, my woodland, though its acres are but few,
And the trust that 1 shall gather home my crops in season due,
Lioe a joy, which he may never grasp, who rules in gorgeous state
Fertile Africa’s dominicus. Happier, happier far my sate 1
'though for me no bees Calabrian store their honey, nor doth wine
Sickening in the Laestrygonian amphora for me refine3
Th0ugh for me no flocks unnumbered, browsing Gallia’s pastures fair,
P-ant beneath their swelling fleeces, Ι at least am free from care ;
Haggard want with direful clamour ravens never at my door,
Nor wouldst thou, if more I wanted, oh my friend, deny me more.
Appetites subdued will make me richer with my scanty gains,
Thau the realms of Alyattes wedded to Mygdonia's plains.
Much will evermore be wanting unto those who much demand ;
Blest, whom Jove with what sufficeth dowers, but dowers with spar-

ing hand.”

It is the nook of earth which, beyond all others, has a
charm for him‚—the one spot where he is all his own.
Here, as Wordsworth beautifully sayS‚ he

‘⁸ Exults in freedom, can with rapture vouch

For the dear blessings of a lowly couch,

A natural meal, days, months from Nature's hand,
. Time, place, and business all at his command.”

It is in this delightful retreat that, in one of his most
graceful odes, he thus invites the fair Tyndaris to pay
him a visit (I. 17) :—

“ My own sweet Lucretilis ofttime can lure
From his native Lycaeus kind Faunus the fleet,
To watch o’er my flocks, and to keep them secure
From summer's fierce winds‚ and its rains, and its heat.

There the mates of a lord of too pungent a fragrance
Securely through brake and o‘er precipice climb‚
And crop, as they wander in happiest vagrance‚
Τ110 arbutus green, and the sweet-scented thyme.

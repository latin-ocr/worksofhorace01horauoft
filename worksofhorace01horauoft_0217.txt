oDE xn1.] , To Lydia. 25

Hope not such love can last for aye
(But thou art deaf to words of mine 2)

Such selfish love, as ruthlessly

Could wound those kisses all divine,
Which Venus steeps in sweets intense
Of her own nectar’s quintessence.

Oh, trebly blest‚ and blest for ever,
Are they, whom true affection binds,

No cold distrusts nor janglings sever
The union of their constant minds,

But life in blended current flows,
Serene and sunny to the close Ξ

¹‘ Then herbs and balms 1 gave thee, to dispel
These livid marks, that do the skin distain,

When lovers bite, where kisses thickly fell,
Stamping their poignant ecstasy in pain.’'

So, too, Shakespeaxe with peculiar fitness puts into Cleopatra’s mouth
allusions to her experiences in this direction, in the first heyday of her
passion for Antony, and again when signansing her constancy to him
by her death :—-

“ Think on me, .
That am with Phoebus· amorous pinches black.”
—Antony and Cleffatra, Act 1. Sc. 5.

¹‘ Τὴθ stroke of death is as a lover's pinch‚

That hurts and is desired.”
- Jbid„ Act V. Sc. 2.

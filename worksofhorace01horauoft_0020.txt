xvi szfe of Horace.

had noted, attest to this hour the vivid accuracy of his
description. The passage in question records an inter-
esting incident in the poet's childhood. Escaping from
his nurse, he has rambled away from the little cottage on
the slopes of Mount Vultur, whither he had probably
been taken from the sultry Venusia to pass his villeg-
giatura during the heat of summer, and is found asleep,
covered with fresh myrtle and laurel leaveS‚ in which the
wood-pigeons have swathed him.

“ When from my nurse erewhile, on Vultur's steep,
I strayed beyond the bound
of our small homestead·s ground,1
Was Ι, fatigued with play, beneath a heap
Of fresh leaves sleeping found,—

Strewn by the storied doves; and wonder fell
On all, their nest who keep
On Acherontia’s steep,

Or in Forentum's low rich pastures dwell,
Or Bantine woodlands deep,

1 In translating this passage I have adopted the reading “ Villulae,”
in preference to the obviously unsatisfactory “Apuliae '⁰ of ordinary
texts. This reading is rejected by Mr Munro, on the ground that “
Horace is averse to the use of diminutives. But he has “parmula,’'
and in the passage in question the diminutive has its force. Ι cannot
better express my own views than in the words of my friend, the late
W. G. Clark, of Cambridge, who long ago conjectured that the line
should be read— ’

“ Altricis extra limina Villulae.”

“It would have been claiming for himself a luxurious bringing up
to have said ‘Villa.’ ‘Villula’ is the little country cottage on the
mountain—side, where the boy was sent from the sultry Venusia, to pass
his villeggiatura during the summer months. Does not this add to the
picture and give force to the illustration? A child wanders from the
cottage door, but he would scarcely be said to wander into a neigh-
bouring province, nor does it matter whether he fell asleep in Apulia οι·
Lucania.”

Give me but these, I ask no more,
These, and a mind entire——

An old age, not unhonoured‚ nor
Unsolaced by the lyre!

ODE XXXII.
To ms LvRE.

HEY ask for us. If 'neath green umbrage thou
And I, my lyre, e’er struck a note, that may
Outlive this year, and years beyond, sing now
A Roman lay3

Lyre, first by him of Lesbos tuned, the brave,

Who resting, when the din of fight was ¹o’er,

Or when he ran, long tossed on oc'ean’s wave,
His bark ashore,

Sang Bacchus and the Muses, Venus too,
And the sweet boy that haunts her everywhere,

And Lycus, for his dark eyes fair to view, ’
And his dark hair.

Ο shell, Apollo's pride, that crown’str the cheer

Of Jove's high feasts, sweet balm of wearied mind,
To me, that duly call on thee, give ear,
To me be kind ἱ

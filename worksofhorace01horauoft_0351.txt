ODE IV.

THE PRAISES OF DRUSUS.

IKE as the thunder-bearing bird
(On whom o’er all the fowls of air
Dominion was by Jove conferred,
Because with loyal care
He bore away to heaven young Ganymede the sair),

Whom native vigour and the rush
Of youth have spurred to quit the nest,
And skies of blue in springtide’s flush
Entice alost to breast
The gales he feared before his lordly plumes were drest‚

Now swooping, eager sor his prey,
Spreads havoc through the ssuttered sold,—
Straight‚ fired by love of food and fray,
v In grapple fierce and bold ·
The struggling dragous rends even in their rocky hold:

Or like the lion's whelp, bu't now
Weaned from his tawny mother's side,
By tendet kidling on the brow
Of some green slope espied, ’
Whose unfleshed teeth she knows will in her blood be dyed;

So dread, so terrible in war
Our noble Drusus shewed, when through
The Rhaetian Alpine glens afar
His conquering eagles flew,
And swiftly the appalled Vindelici o’erthrew.

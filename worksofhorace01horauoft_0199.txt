ome 11. To Augustus Caesar. 7

What god shall we, to save the state from doom,
Importune ; by what pray'r shall virgins pure

“ Their Vesta's ear so long regardless lure,

To listen to their quired hymns? To whom

Will Jove assign the office and the might
To expiate our guilt? Oh, to our pray’r,
Augur Apollo, here at length repair,

Veiling in clouds thy shoulders ivory-white!

Or, laughing Erycina, round whose head
Boy Cupid flits and Mirth on airy wing 3⁹⁶
Or, on thine outcast sons if thou dost fling
Some kindly glances, thou, our Founder dread,

Sated, alas Ξ with wat-'s too lengthened sportl
Who joy’st in glearning helms, and battle's roar,
And, foot to foot with foemen dyed in gore,

The Marsian's flashing eye, and fateful port!

Or else do thou, sweet Maia's winged child,
Doffing the God, descend to earth, and wear
The form of youth, Caesar's avenger, there

. whne thou abicrst, submitting to be styled!

Long, long to heav'n be thy return delayed,
Long, long may'st *thou well pleased beside us stay,
And no fell air wast thee from earth away

At our dark crimes indignant and dismayed!

Rather lead mighty triumphs here as now,
Joy to be called our Prince and Father here,
Nor let the Median unchastised career
Where Romans sway,—our leader, Caesar, thou ἕ

⁴* “And all about her neck and shoulders flew
A flock of little Loves and Sports and Joys,
With nimble wings os gold and purple hue.”
—SPENSER'S Fairy Quem, IV. x. 42.

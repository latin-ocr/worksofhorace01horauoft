154 lee Paz'ns of Leve. [Boon ιν.

Shall verse be set to harp and Inte,

And Phrygian hautboy, not without the flute.
There twice a-day, in sacred lays,

Shall youths and tender maidens sing thy praise ;
And thrice in Salian manner beat

The ground in cadence with their ivory feet.
Me neither damsel now, nor boy

Delights‚ nor credulous hope of mutual joy ;
Nor glads me now thedeep carouse,

Nor with dew-dropping flowers to bind my brows.
But why, oh why, my Ligurine,

Flow my thin tears down these poor cheeks of mine?
Or why, my well-graced words among,

With an uncomely silence sails my tongue?
I dream, thou cruel one, by night,

I hold thee fast ; anon, fled with the light,
Whether in Field of Mars thou be,

Or Tibcr’s rolling streams, 1 follow thee.

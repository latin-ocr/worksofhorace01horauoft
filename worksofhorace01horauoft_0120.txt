cxvi szfe of Horace.

Don't be frightened ! We’re all upon honour, you know,
So out with your tale 2—Gracious powers! is it so?

Poor fellow l Your lot has gone sadly amiss,

When you fell into such a Charybdis as this l

What witch, what magician, with drinks and with charms,
What god can effect your release from her harms ?

So settered, scarce Pegasus' sels, were he near you,

From the sangs of this triple Chimaera would claer you.”

In this poem, which has all the effect of an impromptu,
we have a genre picture of Roman life, as vivid as though
painted, by the pencil of Couture or Gerome.

Serenades were as common an expedient among the
Roman gallants of the days of Augustus as among their
modern successorS. In the fine climate of Greece‚ Italy,
and Spain, they were a natural growth, and involved no
great strain upon a wooe1³s endurance. They assume a
very different aspect under a northern sky, where young
Absolute, found by his Lydia Languish “in the gai-den,
in the coldest night in Janua1y‚ stuck like a dripping
statue,'' presents a rather lugubrious spectacle. Horace
(odes, ΙΙΙ. 7) warns the fair Asterie, during the absence
of her husband abroad, to shut her ears against the
musical nocturnes of a certain Enipeus :—

¹‘ At nightfall shut your doors, nor then
Look down into the street again,
When quavering fifes complain 3 '⁸

using almost the words of Shylock to his daughter
Jessica :-— ν

“ Lock up my doors3 and when you hear the drum
And the vile squeaking qftlze wryneckedfife,
Clamber not you up to the casement then,

N or thrust your head into the public street.”

ODE V11.

ΤΟ TORQUATUS.

HE snows have ssed, and to the meadows now
Returns the grass, their foliage to the trees:

Earth dons another garb, and dwindling low
Between their wonted banks the rivers seek the seas.

The Graces with the Nymphs their dances twine,
Their beauties all unbosomed to the air3
Read in the shifting year, my friend, a sign,
That change and death attend all human hope and care.

Winter dissolves beneath the breath of Spring,
Spring yields to Summer, which shall be no more,
When Autumn spreads her fruits thick-clustering,
And then comes Winter back,—bleak, icy-dead, and hoar.

But moons revolve, and all again is bright z*
We, when we fall, as fell the good and just
AEneas, wealthy Tullus, Ancus wight,
Are but a nameless shade, and some poor grains of dust.

ὓ Mr. Yonge, in his edition of Horace, has called attention to the''
way in which Young‚ in his ‘Night Thoughts,’ N ight 6, uses the same
thought in aid of his plea for man's immortality :-—-

⁴⁴ Look Nature through, 'tis revolution all :
All change, no death ς day follows night, and night
The dying day ; stars rise and set and rise.
Earth takes the example. See the Summer, gay
With her green chaplet‚ and ambrosial flowers,
Droops into pallid Autumn ε Winter grey,
Horrid with frost, and turbulent with storm,

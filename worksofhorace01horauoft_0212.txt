20 To Leuconb‘e. [BOOK 1.

Be wise, your spirit firing
With cups of tempered wine,
And hopes afar aspiring
In compass brief confine.

Use all life’s powers 3
The envious hours ’
Fly as we talk 3⁸* then live to-day‚
Nor fondly to to-morrow trust more than you must or may.

’θ “ For though we slepe or wake, or rome or ride,
Ay fleeth the time, it will no man abide.”
⁴ —CHAUCER, The Clerk's Tale.

‘⁸ Let's take the instant by the soz-ward top !
...... On our quick’st deerees
The inaudible and noiseless soot of time
Steals ere we can effect them.''

-All 's Well that Ends Well, Act v, Sc. 3.

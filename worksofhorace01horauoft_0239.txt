ODE XXX.

TO VENUS.

VENUS, Cnidian queen, and Paphian, tear
Thyself from thy dear Cyprus* for a while,
And to that mansion beautiful repair,
Where Glycera with incense without spare
Invokes thy smile.

Come! and with thee let Cupid loving-warm,
The Graces too, with girdles all unbraced,
And linked with them the N ymphs in jocund swarm,
And Youth that, wanting thee, hath little charm,
And Mercury haste l

‘³‘ It was to Cyprus that Venus proceeded, when she sprang from the
foam of the sea near Cythera. The birth of beauty from the waves has
given rise to many passages of fine descriptive painting by the poets
both of ancient and modern times. Ovid touches the theme with his
usual picturaque force 1——

“ Sic madidos siccat digitis Venus uda capillos,
Et modo maternis tecta videtur aquis.''
—Tristia, 11. 527.
‘¹ So Cytherea fresh from ocean's tide,
With rosy fingers dries her streaming hair,
And seems as she were robed in nought beside
Her own maternal waves, that veil their daughter fair.''

But Mr. Tennyson has surpassed all rivals in the exquisite lines—-

‘¹ Lovelier in her mood
Τὴαῐι in her mould that other, when she came
From barren deeps to conquer all with love ;
And down the streaming crystal dropt ς and she.
Far-fleeted by the purple island sides,
Naked, a double light in air and wave,
To meet her Graees, when they decked her out
For worship without end.”

—lee Princess, Book VII.

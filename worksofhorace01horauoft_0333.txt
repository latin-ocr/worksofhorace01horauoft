ODE XXVII.
To GALATEA‚ como 'ro SEA.

ET omens dire the bad attend,
Who would upon a journey wend‚——

The bitch in whelp, the screeching owl,
The dun she-wolf upon her prowl
of hunger from Lanuvium's rocks,
And, worse than all, the pregnant fox!
At other times, their course to break,
With sudden spring a nimble snake
Will cross the roadway like a dart,'
And make their carriage-horses start!
Ι, with my sage forecasting skill,
For her I love and sear for will,
By my strong pray'rs' resistless force,
Call from the East the raven hoarse,
Ere, scenting rain at hand, again
It seeks its haunts amid the fen.

Go! and be happy, wheresoe'er
Thou go'st‚ and me in memory bear,
Fair Galatea! Boding jay
Nor vagrant crow doth bar thy way.
But see, with what a troubled glare
Orion’s star is setting there!

Trust me! I've wrestled with the gales

Of Hadria’s gulf3 could tell thee tales
Would scare thee, of-*the mischief, too,
Which smooth-lipped western winds can do.
Let our foes’ wives, and all their kind,

Feel rising Auster's sury blind,

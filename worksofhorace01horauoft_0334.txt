To Galatea, going to Sea. [Boox ιιι.

And shudder at black ocean's roar,
What time it smites the trembling shore.
Like thee, Europa her sair side

Did to the treacherous bull confide,

But found. her courage fail, when she
Beheld the monst’ers of the sea;

She who at morning's prime had strayed,
Culling fair flowers from field and glade‚
A votive coronal to twine

For the close-neighbouring wood·nymphs’ shrine,
When night fell round saw nothing, save>
The stars and weltering ocean· wave. ,

Soon as she touched the Cretan ground,
F or five· -score cities fair renowned,
“,How O my sire. ''' did she exclaim, ’
“ Have 1 foregone a daughter's name?
Slave to mad passion, how have I
Broke every holy filial tie?
Whence have I come, and whither flown?
One death is worthless to atone ’
For guilt like mine, so base, 'so deep!
Wake I, and have I'cause to weep? ·
Or is my soul yet free from stain,
And these but phantoms of the hrain,
Mete incorporeal films of dream, ·
Which through Sleep's ivory portal stream?

“Oh madness, to have left my home,
To deem it happier, thus to roam
Yon weary waste of waters blue,
Than gather flowers that freshly grew!
If any to my rage should no'w ' ’ ’
Yield that wild bun, this steel Ι vow,
Should hew him down before me here,
And break his horns, though late so dear.

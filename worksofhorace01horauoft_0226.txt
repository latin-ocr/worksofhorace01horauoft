To MAECENAS.

UR common Sabine wine shall be
The only drink I’ll give to thee,
In modest goblets too ;
’Twas stored in crock of Grecian delf,
Dear knight Maecenas, by myself,
That very day, when through
The theatre thy plaudits tang,
And sportive echo caught the clang,
And answered from the banks
Of thine own dear paternal stream,
Whilst Vatican renewed the theme
Of homage and of thanks Ξ
Old Caecuban, the very best,
And juice in vats Calenian pressed
You drink at home, I know:
My cups no choice Falernian fills,
Nor unto them do Formia’s hius
Impart a tempered glow-

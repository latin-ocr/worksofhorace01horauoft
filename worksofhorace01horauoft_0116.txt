cxii szfe of Horace.

HoxAcE.
What if reviving love
Agajn should intertwine
Our souls‚ if Chloe Iresign,
And Lydia's door for me once more on fiuttering hinges move.

LYmA.
Fairer than stars is he,—

More fickle thou than wind,
Than the vext seas more rude and oft unkind3
But oh, my love. my love, I'd live, I’d die with thee Ξ ” 1
In this graceful trifle Horace is simply dealing with
one of the commonplaces of poetry‚ most probably only
transplanting a Greek flower into the Latin soil. There
is more of the vigour of originality and of living truth in
the following ode to Barine (11. 8), where he gives us
a carneo portrait‚ carved with exquisite finish‚ of that
beaute‘ de diable‚ ‘⁴ dallying and dangerouS,'' as Charles
Lamb called Peg Woffington’s‚ and, what hers was not,
heartleSS‚ which never dies out of the world. A real
person, Lord Lytton thinks, “ was certainly addressed‚
and in a tone which, to such a person, would have been
the most exquisite flattery ; and as certainly the person
is not so addressed by a lover ''—a criticisrn which, com·
ing from such an observer, outweighs the opposite con-
clusions of a score of pedantic scholars :—

⁴‘ If for thy perjuries and broken truth.
Barine, thou hadst ever come to barm,
Hadst lost, but in a nail or blackened moth,
One single chax-m,

I'd trust thee ; but whenothou art most forsworn.
Thou blazest forth with baeuty most supreme,
And of our young men art, noon, night, and mom,

Τὴε thought. the dream.

tinue to be, the despair of translators, is by Mr Patrick Alexander.

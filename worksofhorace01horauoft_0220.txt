28 Τ [ιε Prophecy of Nereus. [Boox 1.

“ Yet in gore thy adulterous locks shall be rolled,

F ull surely, though late. Lo, the scourge of thy race,
Laertiades Ξ Dost thou not see him? Behold l

And Pylian Nestor z—And see, on thy trace ι

“ Rushes Teucer of Salamis, dauntless ancl fell,
And Sthenelus, skilful in combat, nor less

In ruling the war-steed expert to excel,
And close on thy track, too, shall Merion press!

“ Lo, Tydide5‚ surpassing his father in might,
Athirst for thy life-blood, with furious cheer

Is hunting thee out through the thick of the fight,
While before him thou fly'st, like a timorous deer,

“ Who, espying a wolf on the brow of the hill,

Flies far from the pasture, with beart-heaving pants l
Is it thus that thy leman shall see thee sulfil

The promise of all thy presumptuous vaunts?

“The wrath of Achilles shall stay for a while
The downfall of Ilion, and Phrygia’s dames,—
Yet a few winters more, and her funeral pile
In ashes shall fall 'midst Achaian flames Ψ

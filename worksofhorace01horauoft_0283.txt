What though you move the ancient bound,
That marks your humble neighbour's ground,

And avariciously o'erleap

The limits right should bid you keep?
Where lies your gain, that driven from horne
Both wife and husband forth must roam,
Bearing their household gods close pressed „
With squalid babes upon their breast?

Still for the man of weahh, 'mid all

His pomp and pride of place, the hall

Of sure—devouring Orcus waits

With its inevitable gates.

Then why this ceaseless vain unrest?
Earth opens her impartial breast
To prince and beggar both3 normight
Gold e'er tempt Hell's grim satellite
To wast astute Prometheus o’er
From yonder ghastly Stygian shore.
Proud Tantalus and all his race
’ He curbs within that rueful place 3
The toil-worn wretch, who eries fot¹ ease,
Invoked or not, he hears and frees.

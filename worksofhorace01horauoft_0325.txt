ODE XXI.

TO A JAR OF WINE.

PRECIOUS crock, whose summers date,
Like mine, from Manlius' consulate,
Ι wot not whether in your breast
Lie maudlin wail or merry J'est,
Or sudden cholet, or the fire
Of tipsy Love's insane desire,
Or furnes of soft caressing sleep,
Or what more potent charms you keep,
But this I know, your ripened power
Befits some choicely festive hour!
A cup peculiarly mellow
Corvinus asks3 so come, old fellow,
From your time-honoured bin descend,
And let me gratify my friend Ξ .
No churl is he, your charms to slight,
Though most intensely erudite:
And even old Cato's worth, we know,
Took from good wine a nobler glow.

Your magic power of wit can spread
The halo round a dullard's head,
Can make the sage forget his care,
His bosom's inmost thoughts unbare,
And drown his solemn-faced pretence
Beneath your blithesome influence.
Bright hope you bring and vigour back
To minds outworn upon the rack,

cxxviii Life of Horace.

Pompey‚ who wert the first my heart to share,
With whom full oft I've sped the lingering day,
Quaffing bright wine, as in our tents we lay.

With Syrian spikenard on our glistening hair?

With thee 1 shared Philippi's headlong ssight,
My shield behind me left, which was not well,
When all that brave array was broke. and fell

In the vile dust fun many a towering wight.

But me, poor trembler, swist Mercurius bore,
Wrapped in a cloud, through all the hostile din,
Whilst war's tumultuous eddies, closing in,

Swept thee away into the strife once more.

Then pay to Jove the feasts that are his see,
And stretch at ease these war-worn limbs of thine
Beneath my laurel's shade ; nor spare the wine
, Which 1 have treasured through long years for thee.

Pour till it touch the shining goblet's rim,
Care-drowning Massic; let rich ointments flow
From amplest conch l No measure we shall know !

What ἒ shall we wreaths of oozy parsley trim,

Or simple myrtle? Whom will Venus 1 send
To rule our revel? Wild my draughts shall be
As Thracian Bacchanals'‚ for 'tis sweet to me
To lose my wits, when 1 regain my friend.''

When Horace penned the playful allusion here made
to having left his shield on the field of battle (parmuld
non bene relicta), he could never have thought that his
commentators—professed admirerS, too—would extract
from it an admission of personal cowardice. As if any
man, much more a Roman to RomanS, would make such
a confession! Horace could obviously afford to put in
this way the fact of his having given up a desperate

1 Venus was the highest cast of the dice. The meaning here is, Who
shall be the master of our feast ?-that office falling to the member of

the wine-party who threw sixes.

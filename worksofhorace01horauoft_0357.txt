ODE VI.
IN PRAISE OF APOLLO AND DIANA.

THOU god, who art potent that tongue to chastise,
Which e'er by its vaunts the Immortals defies,

As well the sad offspring of Niobe knew,

And Tityus, profanest of ravishers‚ too,

And Phthian Achilles, who wellnigh o'ercame

Proud Troy, of all warriors the foremost in fame,

Yet ne’er with thyself to be matched 3 for though he

Was begotten of Thetis, fair nymph of the sea,

And shook the, Dardanian turrets with sear,

As he crashed through the fray with his terrible spear,

Like a pine, by the biting steel struck and down cast,

’ Or cypress o'erthrown by the hurricane blast,

Far prostrate he fell, and in Teucrian dust

His locks all dishevelled ignobly were thrust.

He would not, shut up in the horse, that was seigned
To be vowed to the rites of Minerva, have deigned

In their ill-timed carouse ou the Trojans to fall,
When the festival dance gladdened Priam’s high hall ;
No! He to the captives remorseless,—oh shame!

In the broad face of day to Greek saggot and flame
Their babes would have flung, yea, as ruthless a doom
Would have wreaked upon those who still slept in the womb,
If won by sweet Venus' entreaties and thine,

The Sire of the Gods, with a bounty benign,

· A City had not to AEneas allowed,

To stand through the ages triumphant and proud!
Thou, who taught’st keen Thalia the plectrum to guide,
Thou, who lavest thy tresses in Xanthus's tide,

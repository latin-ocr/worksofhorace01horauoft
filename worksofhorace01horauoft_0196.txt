To M oecenaS. [BOOK 1.

The merchant, with affright aghast,
When Africus with furious blast
Lashes the Icarian waves to foam,
Extols his quiet inland home 3
But, safe in port, he straight equips
Anew his tempest-battered ships,

By no disasters to be taught
Contentment with a lowly lot.

And there be other—some are fain
Full cups of Massic old to drain,
Nor scorn from the unbroken day ‘
To snatch an hour, their limbs to lay
'Neath leasy arbutus, or dream
Beside some lulling fountain's stream.

The camp makes many a heart beat high,
The trumpet's call, the clarion's cry,
And all the grim array of war,
Which mothers' fearful hearts abhor.

Regardless of his gentle¹ bride,
The huntsman tarries from her side,
Though winds blow keen ’neath skies austere,
If his stanch hounds have tracked the deer,
Or by the meshes rent is seen
Where late a Marsian boar hath been.

Thee doth the ivy’s wreathed bough‚
Meet guerdon of the scholar’s brow,
Commingle with the gods supreme!

Me groves retired from noonday’s beam,
And Nymphs that sport with F auns along,
Dissever from the vulgar throng3

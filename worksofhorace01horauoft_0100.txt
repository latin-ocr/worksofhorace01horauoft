xcvi Life of Horace.

Which has not been forestalled in the days of your prime,
When you scoffed, in your strength, at the inroads of time?
‘⁸ ¹ Keep your boar till it’s rank !' said our sires ; which arose,
Ι am confident, not from their having no nose,
But more from the notion that some of their best
Should be kept in reserve for the chance os a guest :
And though, ere he came, it grew stale on the shelf,
This was better than eating all up by one's sels.
Oh, would 1 had only on earth found a place
In the days of that noble heroic old race Γ·

So much as a question of mere health and good feel-
ing. But now our moralist appeals to higher considera-
tions :—

“ Do you set any store by good name, which we find
Is more welcome than song to the ears of mankind ?
Magnificent turb0t‚ plate richly embossed,

Will bring infinite shame with an infinite eost.

Add kinsmen -and neighbours all furious, your own
- Disgust with yourself, when you find yourself groan

For death, which has shut itself off from your hope,

With not even a. sou left to buy you a rope.

‘⁶ ‘ Most excellent doctrine 2· you answer, ‘ and would,

For people like Transius, be all very good ;

But I have great wealth‚ and an income that brings

In enough to provide vfor the wants of three kings.' ⁰
But is this any reason you should not apply

Your superfluous wealth to ends nobler, more high ?
You so rich, why should any good honest man lack?
Our temples, why should they be tumbling to wrack ?
Wretch, of all this great heap have you nothing to spare
For our dear native land? Or why should you dare
To think that missor-tune will never o'ertake you ?

Oh, then, what a butt would your enemies make you Ξ
Who will best meet reverses? The man who, you find,
Has by luxuries pampered both body and mind ?

Or he who, contented with little, and still

Looking on to the future, and fearful of ill,

Long, long ere a murmur is heard from afar,

In peace has laid up the munitions of war ? '’

Alas for the wisdom of Ofellus the sagei N ineteen

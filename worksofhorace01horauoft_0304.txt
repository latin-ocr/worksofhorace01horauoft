ODE VI.
'ro THE ROMANS.

ΥΕ Romans, ye, though guiltless‚ shall
Dread expiation make for all
The laws your sires have broke,
Till ye repair with loving pains
The gods' dilapidated sanes,
Their statues grimed with smoke !

Ye rule the world, because that ye
Confess the gods' supremacy3
Hence all your grandeur grows !
The gods, in vengeance for neglect,
Hesperia's wretched land have wrecked
Beneath unnumbcred woes.

Twice have Monaeses, and the hordes

Of Pacorus, withstood the swords
Of our ill-omened host;

No more in meagre torques equipped,

But decked with spoils from Romans stripped,
They of our ruin boast.

Dacian and Ethiop have wellnigh

Undone our Rome, distracted by
Intestine feud and fray;

This by his fleet inspiring sear,

That by his shafts, which, far and near,
Spread havoc and dismay.

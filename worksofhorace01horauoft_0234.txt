To leis Muse.

Late relenting‚
Left lamenting—
“ Withered leaves strew wintry brooks!
Ivy garlands greenly darkling,

Myrtles brown with dewdrops sparkling,

Best beseem youth’s glowing looks !''

ODE XXVI.

ΤΟ HIS MUSE.

BELOVED by and loving the Muses,
I fling all my sorrow and care

To the wind, that wherever it chooses
The troublesome freight it may bear.
I care not—not I—not a stiver,
Who in Scythia frozen and drear

’Neath the scourge of a tyrant may shiver‚
Or who keeps Tiridates in sear.

Ο thou in pure springs who delightest‚
Twine flowers of the sunniest glow,
Twine, gentle Pimplea, the brightest
Of wreaths for my Lamia's brow.
Without thee unskilled are my numbers;
Then thou and thy sisterly choir
For him wake the music that slumbers
Unknown in the Lesbian lyre?

[BooK 1.

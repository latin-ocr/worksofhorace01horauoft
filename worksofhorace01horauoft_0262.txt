ODE V11.

TO POMPEIUS VARUS.

DEAR comrade in the days when thou and Ι
With Brutus took the field, his perils bore,
Who hath restored thee, freely as of yore,
To thy horne gods, and loved Italian sky,

Pompey, who wert the first my heart to share ;
With whom full oft I've sped the lingering day,
Quaffing bright wine, as in our tents we lay,

With Syrian spikenard on our glistening h‘air?

With thee I shared Philippi's headlong ssight,
My shield behind me left, which was not well,
When all that brave array was broke, and fen

In the vile dust full many a towering wight.

But me, poor trembler, swist Mercurius bore,
Wrapped in a cloud, through all the hostile din,
Whilst war’s tumultuous eddies, closing in,

Swept thee away into the strife once more.

Then pay to Jove the feasts‚ that are his see,
And stretch at ease these warworn limbs of thine
Beneath my laurel’s shade 3 nor spare the wine
Which 1 have treasured through long years sor thee.

Pour till it touch the shining goblet's rim
Care-drowning Massic : let rich ointments flow
From amplest conchs Ξ No measure we shall know !

What Ξ Shall we wreaths of oozy parsley trim,

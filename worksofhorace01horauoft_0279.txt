omi: κη] To Grosphus, 87

Round thee low countless herds and kine
Of Sicily ; the mare
Apt for the chariot paws for thee the air,
And Afric's costliest dyes incarnadine
The wools which thou dost wearff·

To me a farm of modest size,

And slender vein of song,

Such as in Greece flowed vigorous and strong,
Kind fate hath given, and spirit to despise

The base malignant throng.

 

“ Usque adeo nulla est sincera voluptas,
Sollicitumque aliquid laetz‘s intervenit.''
-Ovm, Affetam. 7.

“ Where is the pleasure matred by no alloy?
Some apprehension ever haunts our j0y. '¹

“ Scilicet interdum miscentur tristia laetis
3 Nec populum toto pectore festa juvant. ''
ι —OV1D, Fasti, 2.
ἰ “ Grief mingles with our mirth‚ when at its best,
And robs our feasts of some part of their zest. '¹
ὓ Literally, ‘⁸ wools are thine,¹ twice steeped in African dye.'’ So
Spenser, in his Virgil's Gnat, line 97 :—— μ
’ “ Ne cares he, if the fleece which him arrays
Be not twice steepkd in Assyrian dye.’'

civ Life of Horace.

ease too strong, to admit of his being carried away by
the headlong impulses of a deeply-seated devotion.
This would probably have been the case even had the
object of his passion been worthy of an unalloyed regard.
As it was,

¹‘ His loves were like most other loves,

‘¹ 'Tis sweeter sor thee despairing,
Than aught in the world beside.'·

beauty that is not too coy,’' is the Alpha and Omega of
his persona] creed. How should it have been otherwise Ρ

the ranks of those who made market of their charms, he
was not likely to regard the fairest face, after the first
‘heyday of his youth was past, as worth the pain its
owner’s caprices could inflict. For, as seen under that
phase, woman was apt to be both mercenary and capri-

fickleness of more than one mistreSS, the probability is
--and this he was too honest not too feel—that they had
only forestalled him in inconstancy. .

ODE XIX.
'ro GLYCERA.

THE ruthless mother of wild desires,
And Theban Semele's fervent son,

And wauton idlesse have kindled fires
Within me, Ι dreamed 1 had long outrun.

Ι am maddened by Glycera's beauty’s blaze‚—-
The marble of Paros is dull beside it—

By her pretty, provoking, and petulant ways,
And face too dazzling for eye to 'bide it.

Into me rushing‚ hath Venus quite
Forsaken her Cyprus, nor lets me chant

The Scyths and the Parthians, dauntless in ssight,
Nor aught that to Love is irrelevant.

Hither, boys, turf of the freshest bring,
Vervain, and incense, and wine unstinted!

The goddess less fiercely my heart shall sting,
When the victim's gore hath her altar tinted.

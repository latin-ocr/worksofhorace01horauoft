οὐκ xm] Oa tlte prevaz‘ling Luxury.

Land, home, and winsome wife must all be left 3

And cypresses abhorred,

Alone of all the trees

That now your fancy please‚

Shall shade his dust, who was a little while their lord.

Then, too, your long-imprisoned Caecuban

A worthier heir shall drain,

And with a. lordlier wine,

Than at the feasts divine

Of pontiffs flows, your floor in wassailry shall stain.

ODE XV.
ON THE PREVAILING LUXURY.

OON regal piles each rood of land
Will from the farmer's ploughshare take,
Soon ponds be’ seen on every hand
More spacious than the Lucrine lake.

Soon the unwedded plane di'splace

The vine-wreathed elm; and violet bed
And myrtle bush‚ and all the race

Of scented shrubs their fragrance shed,

Where fertile olive thickets made
Their owner rich in days of old3

And laurels with thick-woven shade
At bay the scorching sunbeams hold.

ODE XXV.

ΤΟ BACCHUS.

HITHER, whither, full of thee,
Bacchus, dost thou hurry me?

Say, what groves are these I range,
Whirled along by impulse strange,
What the caveS, through which I fly ?
Tell me, in what grot shall 1
Swell illustrious Caesar's praise,
Striving to the stars to raise
Worth that worthy is to shine
In Jove's council·hall divine?

, 1 a strain sublime shall pour,
Ne’er by mortal sung before.
As the Eviad, from some height,

. Sleepless through the livelong night,‘

With a thrill of wild amaze

Hebrus at his feet surveys,

Thrace, enwrapped in snowy sheet,
Rhodope by barbarous feet

Trodden‚ so where'er I rove

Far from human haunts‚ the grove,
Rock,·and crag, and woodlancl height
Charm me with a wild delight.

Ο thou, who dost the N aiads, and
The Bacchanalian maids command,'
Whose hands uproot‚ such strength have they,
Ash-trees with storms of ages grey,

On tlte prevailz'ng Luxury.

It was not so, when Romulus
Our greatness fostered in its prime,
Nor did our great forefathers thus,
In unshorn Cato’s simple time.>

Man’s private fortunes then were low,
The public income great3 in these

Good times no long-drawn portico
Caught sor its lord the northern breeze.

Nor did the laws our sires permit
Sods dug at random to despise,

As for their daily homes unfit 3
And yet they bade our cities rise

More stately at the public charge,
And did, to their religion true,
The temples of the gods enIarge,
And with fair-sculptured stones renew.

Appeal to tlte Roman People. xxxv

And the bones of great Quirinus. now religiously enshrined,
shall be flung by sacrilegious hands to the sunshine and the wind.

‘¹ And if ye all from ills so dire ask how yourselves to free,
Or such at loest as would not hold your lives unworthily‚
No better counsel mn I urge, than that which erst inspired
The stout Phocaeans when from their doomed city they retired,
Their fields, their household gods, their shrines surrendering as a prey
To the wild boat and the ravening wolf ; so we, in our dismay,
Where’er our wandering steps may chance to carry us should go,
Or wheresoe’er across the seas the fitful winds may blow.

‘⁸ How think ye then ? If better course none offer, why should we
Not seize the happy auspices, and boldly put to sea?
But let us swear this oath ;—‘ Whene er, is e'er shall come the time,
Rocks upwards from the deep shall float, return shall not be crime;
Nor we be loath to back our sails, the ports of home to seek,
When the waters of the Po shall lave Matinum’s risted peak.
Or skyey Apenninus down into the sea be rolled,
Or wild unnatural desires such monstrous revel hold,
That in the stag's endeannents the tigress shall delight,
And the turtle-dove adulterate with the falcon and the kite,
That unsuspicious herds no more shall tawny lions sear,
And the he-goat, smoothly sleek of skin‚ through the briny deep

career 1 '

This having swom, and what beside may our returning stay,
Straight let us all, this City's doomed inhabitants, away,
Or those that rise above the herd, the few of nobler sou13
The craven and the hopeless here on their ill-starred beds may loll.
Ye who can feel and act like men, this woman’s wail give o’er,
Andfly to regions far away beyond the Etruscan shore 1
The cioeling ocean waits us ; then away, where nature smiles,
To those sair lands, those blissful lands, the rich and happy Isles !
Where Ceres year by year crowns all the untilled land with sheaves,
And the vine with purple clusters droops, unpruned of all her leaves;
Where the olive buds and burgeons‚ to its promise 'ne'er untrue,
And the russet fig adorus the tree, that graffshoot never knew 3
Where honey from the hollow oaks doth ooze‚ and crystal rills
Come dancing down with tinkling feet from the sky-dividing hills ;
There to the pails the she-goats come, without a master's word,
And horne with udders brimming broad returns the friendly herd.
There round the sold no surly bear its midnight prowl doth make,
Nor teems the rank and heaving soil with the adder and the snake ;
There no contagion smites the flocks, nor blight of any star
With sury of remorseless heat the sweltering herds doth mar.

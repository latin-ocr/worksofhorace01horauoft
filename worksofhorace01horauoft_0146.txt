cxlii Life of Horace.

serene ”⁷(Odes, II. 13). But this after-life was a cold,
sunleSS‚ unsubstantial thing, lower in quality and degree
than the full, vigorouS‚ passionate life of this world.

The nobler spirits of antiquity, it hardly need be said,
had higher dreams of a future state than this. For them,
no more than for us, was it possible to rest in the con-
viction that their brief and troubled career on earth was
to be the “be all and the end all '' of existence, or that
those whom they had loved and lost in death became
thenceforth as though they had never been. It is idle
to draw, as is often done, a different conclusion from
such phrases as that after death we are a shadow and
mere dust, “pulvis et umbra sumus! '¹ or from Horace’s
bewildered cry (odes, Ι. 24), when a friend of signal
nobleness and purity is suddenly struck down—“ Ergo
Quinctilium perpetuus sopor urget? ''—-“ And is Quinc-
tilius, then, weighed down by a sleep that knows no
waking? '’ We might as reasonably argue that Shake-
speare did not believe in a life after death because he
makes Prospero say-—

. “We are such stuff
As dreams are made of, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.”

Horace and Shakespeare both believed in an immor-
tality‚ but it was an immortality different in its kind.
Horace, indeed,-—wh0‚ as a rule, is wisely silent on a
question which for him had no solution, however much
it may have engaged his speculations‚——has gleams not
unlike those which irradiate our happier creed, as when
he writes (odes, ΙΙΙ. 2) of “ Virtus, recludens immeritis
mori, coelum negata tentat iter via ”--

ουκ xx.] To M ceccnas.

Though fitter for the dance, and mirth, and jest‚
Than for the battle's deadly shock reputed,

Thou didst approve thyself, o'er all the rest
Alike for peace or warfare aptly suited.

Thee, gloriously bedeeked with horn of gold,
With gently wagging tail soothed Cerberus greeted
And licked thy limbs and feet with tongue threefold,
As from his shady realrn thy steps retreated.

ODE XX.
To MAECENAS.

ΟΝ pinion newly plumed and strong
1’11 cleave the liquid air
Predestinate, true child of song Ξ
Α double form to wear.
Earth shall not keep me from the skies,
I'll pierce the smoke of towns,
And, soaring far alost,‘ despise
Their envy and their frowns.

Though cradled at a poor man's hearth,
His offspring‚ 1 shall not

Go down to mix with common earth,
Forgetting and sorgot.

No ! 1, whom thou, Maecenas, clear,
Dost mark with thy esteem‚

Shall never pine, a phantom drear,
By sad Cocytus' stream.

ODE XXXIV.
THE POET’S CONFESSION.

NTO the gods my vows were scant
And few, whilst I professed the cant
Of philosophie lore,
But now I back my sails perforee,
F ain to retrace the beaten course,
I had contemned before.

F or Jove, who with his forked levin

Is wont to rend the louring heaven,
Of late with hurtlings loud

His thunder-pacing steeds did urge,

And winged car along the verge
Of skies without a cloud 3

Whereat the huge earth reeled with sear,
The rivers, Styx, the portal drear

Of Taenarus abhorred,
While distant Atlas caught the sound,
And quivered to its farthest bound.

The world’s great god and lord ,

Can change the lofty to the low,
The mighty ones of earth o’erthrow‚
Advancing the obscure ;
F ate wrests the crown from lordly brow
On his to plant it, who but now
Was poorest of the poor.

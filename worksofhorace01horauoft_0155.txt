Anticzpates leis Fame.

For long as with his Vestals mute
Rome's Pontifex shall climb
The Capitol, my fame shall shoot

F resh buds through future time.

Where brawls loud Aufidus, and came
Parched Daunus erst‚ a horde

Of rustic boors to sway. my name
ShaJl be a household word 3

As one who rose from mean estate,
The first with poet fire

AEolie song to modulate
To the Italian lyre.

Tben grant, Melpomene, thy son
Τὴγ guerdon proud to wear,
And Delphic laurels, duly won, '

Bind thou upon my hair !'’

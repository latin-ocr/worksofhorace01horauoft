ODE XXXI.
THE POET’S PRAYER.

WHAT asks the poet, who adores
Apollo’s virgin shrine,
What asks he, as he freely pours
The consecrating wine?

Not the rich grain, that waves along
Sardinia’s fertile land,

Nor the unnumbered herds, that throng
Calabria’s sultry strand 3

Not gold, nor ivory³s snowy gleam‚
The spoil of far Cathay,

Nor fields, which Liris, quiet stream,
Gnaws silently away.

Let fortune's favoured sons the vine
Of fair Campania hold ;

The merchant quaff the rarest wine
From cups of gleaming gold ;

For to the gods the man is dear
Who scathelessly can brave,

Three times or more in every year,
The wild Atlantic wave.

Let olives, endive, mallows light
Be all my fare; and health

Give thou, LatoiiS, so I might
Enjoy my present wealth Ξ

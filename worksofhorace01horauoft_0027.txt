Horace’s Father. xxiii

Nor such in act alone, but in repnte,

Till even scandal's tattling voice was mute.

No dread had he that men might taunt or jeer,

Shouid I, some future day, as auctioneer,

pleased to give me such a father ; that from earliest years I had the ex-
ample of a rw] man of God's own making continually before me? Let

’ me Imm of him. Let me wn'te my books, as he built his houses, and

waJk as blamelessly through this shadow world ; is God so will to rejoin
him at last.”—‘ Reminiscences,' vol. i. p. 15.

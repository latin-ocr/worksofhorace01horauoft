cxviii sze of Horace.

Though nor gifts nor entreaties can win a soft answer.
Nor the violet pale of my love-ravaged cheek,

To your husband's intrigue with a Greek ballet-danoer
Though you are still blind, and forgiving and rneek ;

Yet be not as cruel—forgive my upbraiding--'
As snakes, nor as hard as the toughe'st of oak3

To stand out here, drenched to the skin, serenading
·A11 night, may in time prove too much osa Joke.” ’

It is not often that Horace's poetry is vitiated by bad
taste. Strangely enough, almost the only instances of it
occur where he is writing of women, as in the Ode to
Lydia (Book Ι. 2 5) and to Lyce (Book IV. 13). Both
ladies seem to have been former favourites 'of his, and
yet the burden of these poenis is exultation in the decay
of their charmS. The defidening influence of mere sen-
suality, and of the prevalent low tone of moraJS, must
indeed have been great, when a man “ so singularly sus-
ceptible‚'' as Lord Lytton has truly described him, “to
amiable, graceful‚ gentle, and noble impressions of man
and of life‚'' could write of a woman whom he had once
loved in a strain like this :—

“ The gods have heard, the gods have heard my prayer ;-
Yes, Lyce l you are growing old, and still
You struggle to look ἰείη
You drink‚ and dance, and trill
Your songs to youthsul love, in accents weak
With wine, and age, and passion. Youthful Love 1
He 'dwells in Chia’s cheek‚
And hears her ham-strings'move.
Rude boy, he flies like lightning o'er the heath
Past withered trees like γους you're wrinkled now;
The white has left your teeth.
And settled on your broW.
Your Coan silks, your J‘ewels bright as stars-
Ah no 1 they bring not back the days os old.
In public calendars -
By flying time enrolled.

ODE XV.

THE PROPHECY OF NEREUS.

AS the treacherous shepherd bore over the deep
His hostess, fair Helena, Nereus arose,
Hushed the war of the winds for a season to sleep‚

And thus sang the doom of retributive woes:

“Thou bearest her home with an omen of dread,
Whom Greece shall reclaim, with her myriads vowed
To tear by the sword thy false mate from thy bed,
And crush Priam's empire, the ancient, the proud.

, “ Horse and man, how they labour ἱ What deaths shall
overwhelm, ι
A'nd all for thy crime, the Dardanians in night!
See Pallas preparing her aegis and helm,
Her chariot‚ and all the fierce frenzy of fight!

“ Go, trim as thou wilt, boy, thy loose-flowing curls,

Go, vaunt thee, that Venus will shield thee from wrong,
And, laid with thy lute 'midst a bevy of girls,

Troll measures effeminate all the day long.

“ Ay, hide an' thou mayst in the couch of thy lust

From the death-dealing spear, and the arrows of Crete,
From the roar of the battle, its carnage, its dust,

And Ajax pursuing, remorseless and fleet!

clxxxvi Life of Horace.

A great success may here and there be achieved‚ which
at once satisfies the scholar, and charms the English
reader. But how much more frequently does it happen
that the result is displeasing to both ? The subtle aroma
of expression is not to be fixed by pseudo-classical turns i
of phrase, or by artifices of rhythm, which are foreign
to the structure and genius of our language. Unless
a translation can commend itself to our admiration, as
intrinsically interesting and good as a piece of harmonicus
English verse, it can never be admitted to represent what
is in the original a masterpiece of Latin verse.

A point of great difficulty with all translators must be
the treatment of the lighter odes—mere vers de εοαὶέίέ,
invested by the language for us with a certain stateliness,
but which were probably regarded with a very different
feeling by the small contemporary circle to which they
were addressed. To catch the tone of these, to be light
without being flippant, to be playful without being vulgar,
demands a delicacy of touch which it is given to few to
acquire even in original composition, and which in trans-

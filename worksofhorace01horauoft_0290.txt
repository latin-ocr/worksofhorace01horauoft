98 In Praise of Contentment. [Boon 111.

Or troops of clients, clamorous in his cause3
Still Fate doth grimly stand,
And with impartial hand
The lots of lofty and of lowly draws
From that capacious urn,
Whence every name that lives is shaken in its turn.

To him, above whose guilty head,
suspended by a thread,
The naked sword is hung for evermore,
Not feasts Sicilian shall
With all their cates recall
That zest the simplest fare could once inspire ;
Nor song of birds, nor music of the lyre
Shall his lost sleep restore:
But gentle sleep shuns not
The rustic's lowly cot,
Nor mossy bank, o’ercanopied with trees,
Nor Tempe's leafy vale stirred by the western breeze.

The man, who lives content with whatsoe'er
Sufficeth sor his needs,

The storm-tossed ocean vexeth not with care,

Nor the fierce tempest which Arcturus breeds,
When in the sky he sets,

> Nor that which HoeduS, at his rise‚ begets:
Nor will he grieve, although
His vines be all laid low
Beneath the driving hail,

Nor though, by reason of the drenching rain,
Or heat, that shrivels up his fields like fire,
Or fierce extremities of winter's ire,

Blight shall o’erwhelm his fruit-trees and his grain,
And all his farm’s delusive promise fail.

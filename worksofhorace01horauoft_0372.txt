1 80 T 0 Augustus. [Boox iv.

The honour long desired, the glorious fame
Of countless vanquished foeS,
And vanquished empires bowed in homage to thy sway!

Thee the Cantabriam, unsubdued tin now,
The Mede, the Indian‚—-thee -
The Scythian roaming free,
Unwedded to a home,
With wondering awe obey,
Ο mighty Caesar, thou
Of Italy and sovereign Rome
The present shield2 the guardian, and the stay!
Thee Nile, who hides from mortal eyes
The springs where he doth rise,
Thee Ister, arrowy Tigris thee,
Thee, τοο, the monster-spawning sea,
Which round far Britain's islands breaks in soam,
Thee Gallia, whom no form of death alarms,
Iberia thee, through all her swarms
Of rugged warriors, hears;
Thee the Sicambrian, who
Delights in carnage, too,
Now laying down his arms,
Submissively reveres!

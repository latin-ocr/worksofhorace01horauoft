Ridicule qf GourmetS. xcvii

centuries have come and gone, and the spectacle is still
before us of the same selfishness‚ extravagance, and f011y‚
which he rebuked so well and so vainly, but which we
now see pushed to even greater excess‚ and more widely
diffused, enervating the frames and ruining the fortunes
of one great section of society, and helping to inspire
another section, and that a dangerous one, with angry
disgust at the hideous contrast between the opposite
extremes of wretchedness and luxury which everywhere
meets the eye in the great cities of the civilised
world.

In the Fourth Satire of the Second Book, Horace
ridicules, in a vein of exquisite irony, the gourmets of
his day, who made a philosophy of flavours, with whom
sauces were a science, and who had condensed into
aphorisms the merits of the poultry, game‚ or fish of the
different and often distant regions from which they were
brought to Rome. Catius has been listening to a dis-
sertation by some Brillat-Savarin of this class, and is
hurrying home to commit to his tablets the precepts by
which he professes himself to have been immensely
ΒἬ, when he is met by Horace, and prevailed upon
to· eat some of them in the very words of this philoso-
pher of the dinner-table. Exeeedingly curious they are,
throwing no small light both upon the materials of the
Roman cuisine and upon the treatment by the Romans
of their wines, Being delivered, moreover, with the
epigrammatic precision of philosophical axi01nS, their
, effect is infinitely amusing. T hus :—

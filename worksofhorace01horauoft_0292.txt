ODE 11.

TO HIS COMPANIONS.

IN war’s stern school our youth should be
Steeled stoutly to endure
The ills which sharp necessity
Inflicts upon the poor3
To make theAParthians fly in sear
Before the terrors of their spear3

To live alert at danger’s call,
Encamped on heath or down3

Then, as they view him from the wall
Of their beleaguered town,

With sighs the wan-ing monarch's dame

And virgin daughter shall exclaim:

“ Oh grant, ye godS, our royal lord‚
Unskilled in war's array,

Provoke not, by his bootless sword,
Yon lion to the fray,

Who rushes with infuriate roar

Through carnage, dropping gouts of gore 1 '²

For our dear native land to die
Is glorious and sweet ς
And death the coward slaves that fly
Pursues with steps as fleet,
Nor spares the loins and backs of those
Unwarlike youths who shun their foes.

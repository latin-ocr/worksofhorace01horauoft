So to her Ionely palace—walls she came,

With eye serene their desolation viewed,

And the fell asps with fearless fingers wooed
To dart their deadliest venom through her frame 3

Embracing death with desperate calm, that she
Might rob Rome's galleys of their royal prize,
Queen to the last, and ne'er in humble guise

To swell a triumph's haughty pageantry Η(-

ODE XXXVIII.
To ms CUPBEARER.

PERSIA’S pomp, my boy, Ι hate,
No coronals of flowerets rare
For me on bark of linden plait,
Nor seek thou, to discover where
The lush rose lingers late.

With unpretending myrtle twine
Nought else! It fits your brows,
Attending me, it graees mine,
As I in happy ease carouse
Beneath the thick-leaved vine.

‘¹ I died a Queen. The Roman soldier found
Me lying dead, my crown about my brows,
A name for ever! lying robed and crowned,
Worthy a Roman spouse.''
—TENNYSON'S Dream ofFair Womcn.

cvi szfe of Horace.

Twice also in his later odes (IV. 1 and 13), Horace re-
curs with 'tenderness to the “gentle Cinara '' as having
held the paramount place in his heart. She was his one
bit of romanoe, and this all the more that she died young.
“Cinarae breves annos fala dederunt ''—“ Few years the
fates to Cinara allowed ς ” and in his meditative rambles
by the Digentia, the lonely poet, we may well believe,
often found himself sighing “ for the touch of a vanished
hand, and the sound of a voice that is still.”

In none of his love-poems is the ring of persona] feeling
more perceptible than in the following. It is one of his
earliest, and if we are to identify the Neaera to whom it
is addressed with the Neaera referred to in Ode 14, Book
111„ it must have been written Consule Planco‚—that is,

in the year of Horace’s return to Rome after the battle
of Philippi.

“ ’Twas night !—let me recall to thee that night!

The silver moon in the unclouded sky

Amid the lesser stars was shining bright,
When, in the words Ι did adjure thee by,

Thou with thy clinging arms, more tightly knit
Around me than the ivy clasps the oak,

Didst breathe a vow—mocking the gods with it— ¹
A vow which, false one, thou hast foully broke3

That while the ravening wolf should hunt the flocks‚
The shipman's foe, Orion, vex the sm,

And zephyrs waft the unshorn Apollo’s looks,
So long wouldst thou be fond, be true to me!

T 0 Varus. [Boon 1.

In the madmen of Thrace, too, a warning is set,
Who, lost in their Bacchanal frenzy, forget

The bounds that dissever the right from the wrong,
And sweep on the tide of their passions along.

Bright god of the vine, 1 never will share
In orgies so vile and unholy, nor tear
The clusters of various foliage away,
That keep thy blest mysteries veiled from the day.
Then clash not the cymbals, and wind not the horn,
Dread sounds, of whose maddening accents are born
Blind Self-love, and Vanity lifting on high
Its feather-brained head, as ’twould strike at the sky,
And Frankness, transparent as crystal, that shows
In its babbling incontinence all that it knows.

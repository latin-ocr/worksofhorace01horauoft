ODE XIV.
'ro THE ROMANS.

AESAR, Ο people, who of late,
Like Hercules defying fate,
Was said the laurel to have sought
Which only may by death be bought,
To his home-gods returns again
Victorious from the shores of Spain l

To the Just gods to pay their rite5‚
Now let the matron‚ who delights
In him, her peerless lord, repair,
And our great leader’s sister fair;
And with them go the mothers chaste‚
Their brows with suppliant fillets graced,
Of our fresh maids‚ and of the orave
Young men, who late have 'scaped the grave ἱ
And, O ye boys, and new-made brides,
Hush every word that ill betides!

From me this truly festal day
Shall drive each cloud of care away3
Nor shall Ι draw in sear my breath
For civil broil or bloody death,
While Caesar sway o'er earth shall bear.
Away, then, bey, bring chaplets fair,
Bring unguents, and with these a jar,
That recollects the Marsian war,

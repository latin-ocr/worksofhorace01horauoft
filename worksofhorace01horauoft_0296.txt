104 The A polheosis of Romulus, [Boon 111.

“ Yes, let her spread her name of sear,

To farthest shores ς where central waves
Part Africa from Europe, where
Nile’s swellin'g current half the year

The plains with plenty laves.

“ Still let her scorn to search with pain
For gold, the earth hath wisely hid,
Nor strive to wrest with hands profane
To mortal use and mortal gain
What is to man forbid*

“ Let earth's remotest regions still Ἰ
Her conquering arms to glory call, .

Where scorching suns the long day fill,

Where mists and snows and tempests chill
H old reckless bacchanal.

“ But let Quirinus’ sons beware,

For they are doomed to sure annoy,
Should they in foolish fondness e’er
Or vaunting pride the homes repair

Of their ancestral Troy.

“In evil hour should Troy once more
Arise‚ it shall be crushed anew,

By hosts that o'er it stride in gore,
By me conducted, as of yore,
Jove’s spouse and sister too.

ἃ “ And with hands profane
Rifled the bowels of their mother earth

For treasures better hid.”
—Paradise Lost, 1. 686.

172 ᾖ To Lollius. [Boox 1v.

Of rapine and fraud the avenger austere,

To wealth and its all-suaring blandishrnents proof,
The Consul art thou not of one single year,

But. as oft as a judge, from all basenessssalooss

Thou hast made the expedient give place to the right,
And flung back the bribes of the guilty with scorn,

And on through crowds warring against thee with might
Thy far-flashing arms hast triumphantly borne.

Not him, who of much that men prize is possessed,
Mayst thou fitly call “ blest ;'’ he may claim to enjoy
More fitly, more truly, the title of “ blest‚''
Who wisely the gifts of the gods can employ 3-

Who want, and its hardships, and slights can withstand‚
And shrinks from disgrace as more bittet than death,

Not he for the friends whom he loveS‚ or the land
Of his fathers will dread to surrender his breath.

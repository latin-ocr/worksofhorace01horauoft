xlii Life of Horace.

The days and nights‚ they wax and wane.
Yet bring me no release from pain 3

Nor can I ease, howe’er Ι gasp,

'Ibe spasm, which holds me in its grasp.'’

Here we have all the well-known symptoms of a man
under a malign magica] influence. In this extremity
’ Horace affects to recant all the mischief he has formerly
spoken of the enchantress. Let her name what penance
he will, he is ready to perform it. If a hundred steers
will appease her wrath, they are hers3 or if she prefers
to be sung of as the chaste and good, and to range above
the spheres as a golden star, his lyre is at her service.
Her parentage is as unexceptionable as her life is pure 3
but whilst ostentatiously disclaiming his libels, the poet
takes care to insinuate them anew, by apostrophising her,

in conclusion, thus :—
⁶¹ Thou who dost ne'er in haglike wont
Among the tombs of paupers hunt
For ashes newly laid in ground,

Love-charms and philtres to compound‚
Thy heart is gentle, pure thy hands.''

Of course, Canidia is not mollified by such a recanta-
tion as this. The man who—-

‘⁸ Branding her name with ill renown‚
Made her the talk os all the town.'’

is not so lightly to be forgiven.

‘¹ You’d have a speedy doom ? But no,
It shall be lingering‚ sharp, and slow.’'

The pangs of TantaluS, of PrometheuS, or of SisyphuS‚
are but the types of what his shall be. Let him try to
hang, drown‚ stab himself—his efforts will be vain :—

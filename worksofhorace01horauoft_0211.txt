ODE XI.

To LEUCON6E.

SK not—such lore's forbidden—
What destined term may be
within the future hidden,
For υς, Leucon6e.

Both thou and 1

Must quickly die !
Content thee, then, nor madly hope
To wrest a false assurance from Chaldean horoscope*

Far nobler, better were it,
Whate’er may be in store‚
With soul serene to bear it 3

If winters many more
Jove spare for thee,

’ Or this shall be
The last, that now with sullen roar
Scatters the Tuscan surge in foam upon the rock-bound shore.

⁴* ‘⁸ When all looks fair about, and thou seest not a cloud so big as a
to thraeten thee, sorget not the wheel of things: think of sullen
vic1ssitudes, but beat not thy brains to foreknow them. Be armed
against such obscurities rather by submission than foreknowledge. The
knowledge of future evils mortifies present felicities, and there is more
content in the uncertainty or ignorance of them. This favour our
Saviour vouchsased unto Peter when He foretold not His death in plain
terms, and so by an ambiguous and cloudy delivery damped not the spirit
of His disciples. But in the assured foreknowledge of the deluge Noah
lived many years under the affliction of a flood; and Jerusalem was
taken unto Jeremy before it was besieged. ''—S1R T. BROWNE’S Christian
Morals, part iii.,§ 16.

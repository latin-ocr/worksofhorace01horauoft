ODE XXXV.
* To FORTUNE.

O PLEASANT Antium’s goddess queen,
Whose presence hath avail
Mortals to list from mean estate,
Or change triumphal hymns elate
To, notes of funeral wail 3

Thee with beart-anxious prayer invokes
The rustic at the plough,
Thee, mistress of the ocean-wave,
Whoe'er Carpathia’s surges brave
With frail Bithynian prow3 “

Thee Scythia’s ever-roving hordes,
And Dacians rude revere,
Thee cities‚ tribes, Rome’s dauntless band,
Barbarie monarchs’ motherS, and
Empurpled tyrants sear-3

Lest thou shouldst crush their pillared state
Beneath thy whelming foot,

Lest madding crowds with shrill alarms

.Pealing the cry—“ To arms Ξ To arms !''
Should seated -thrones uproot.

Before thee evermore doth Fate
Stalk phantom-like, and bear

In brazen hand huge nails dispread ;

And wedges grim, and molten lead,
And iron clamps are there.

oon 111.] To Dellius: 65

It recks not, whether thou ’
Be opulent, and trace
Thy birth from kings, or bear upon thy brow
Stamp of a beggar's race ;
In rags or splendour, death at thee alike,
That no compassion hath for aught of earth, will strike.

One road,1and to one bourne

We all are goaded. Late
Or soon will issue from the urn
Of unrelenting Fato
The lot that in yon bark exiles us all
To undiscovered shores, from which is no recall.

Why dost thou build up stately rooms on high,
Thou, who art underground to lie ?

Thou sow'st and plantest, but no fruit must see,
For Daeth, alas 1 is sowing thee.’'

—CovaEv.

“ My parks, my walks, my manors that Ι had,
Even now forsake me ς and of all my lands
Is nothing left me, but my body's length.”

—SHAKESPfiARE. Henry VJ.. Pt. m. Aet v. Sc. 2.

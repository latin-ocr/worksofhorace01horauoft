Ode to Phidyle. cxxv

It was probably not within the circle of his city friends
that Horace saw the women for whom he entertained the
deepest respect, but by the hearth-fire in the farmhouse‚
“the homely house, that harbours quiet rest,'' with which
he was no less familiar, where people lived in a simple
and natural way, and where, if anywhere, good wives and
mothers were certain to be found. It was manifestly by
some woman of this class that the following poem (odes,

“ If thou, at each new moon, thine upturned palms,
My rustic Phidyle, to heaven shalt list,
The Lares soothe with steam of fragrant balms,
A sow, and fruits new-plucked, thy simple gift,

Nor venomed blast shall nip thy fertile vine, >
Nor mildew blight thy harvest in the ear ;

Νοι· shall thy flocks, sweet nurslings, peak and pine,
When apple-bearing Autumn chills the year.

The victim marked for sacrifice, that seeds

On snow-capped Algidus, in leafy lane

Of oak and ilex, or on Alba's meads,
With its rich blood the pontiff's axe may stain ;

Thy little gods for humbler tn'bute call

Than blood of many victims ς twine for thern
of rosemary a simple coronal,

And the lush myrtle's frail and fragrant stem.

The costliest sacrifice that wealth can make
From the incensed Penates less commands

A soft response, than doth the poorest cake,
If on the altar laid with spotless hands.''

When this was written, Horace had got far beyond the

Epicurean ereed of his youth (ante, p. lvii). He had

come to believe in the active intervention of a Supreme

Horace’s S tyle. i cxlix

was the first to do this successfully‚ if we except Catullus
in some slight but exquisite poemS, so he was the last.
“Of lyrists,” says Quintilian, “Horace is alone, one
might say, worthy to be read. For he has bursts of in-
spiration‚ and is full of playful delicacy and grace3 and
in the variety of his images, as well as in expression,

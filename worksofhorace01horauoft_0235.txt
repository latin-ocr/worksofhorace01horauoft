ODE XXVII.

THE CAROUSAL.

OLD Ξ hold Ξ ’Tis for Thracian madmen to fight
With wine-cupS, that only were made for delight.
'Tis barbarous—brutal ἔ I beg of you all,
Disgrace 'not our banquet with bloodshed and brawl 1

Sure Median scimitars strangely accord

With lamps and with wine at the festival board!
'Tis out of all rule! Friends, your places resume,
And let us have order once more in the room!

If 1 am to join you in pledging a beaker

Of this stout F alernian, choicest of liquor,
Megilla’s fair brother must say, from what eyes
Flew the shaft, sweetly fatal, that causes his sighs.

How—dumb! Then I drink not a drop. N ever blush‚
Whoever the fair one may be, man! T ush‚ tush!
She’ll do your taste credit, I'm certain—for yours

Was always select in its little amours.

Don't be frightened! We're all upon honour, you know,
So out with your tale! Gracious powers! Is it so?
Poor sellow! Your lot has gone sadly amiss,

When you fell into such a Charybdis as this!

Δ What witch, what magician‚ with drinks and with charms,

What god can effect your release frorn her harms?
So settered‚ scarce Pegasus' self, were he near you,
From the fangs of this triple Chimaera might clear you!

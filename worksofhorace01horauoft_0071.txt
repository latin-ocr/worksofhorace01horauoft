Inculcates Clzarity in, Judgment. lxvii

“ Arch Horace, while he strove to mend,
Probed all the foibles of his smiling friend ;
Played lightly round and round each peccant part,
And won, unfelt, an entrance to his heart.''—(Gifford.)

And we may be sure the same qualities were even more
conspicuous in his personal intercourse with his friends.
Satirist though he waS, he is continually inculcating the
duty of charitable judgments towards all men.

‘⁴ What’s done we partly may compute,
But know not what‘s resisted,”

is a thought osten suggested by his works, The best
need large grains of allowance, and to whom should these
be given if not to friends? Here is his creed on this
subject (Satire5‚ Ι. 3) :—

“ True love, we know, is blind; defects, that blight
The loved one's charms, escape the lover’s sight,
N ay, pass for beauties3 as Balbinus shows
A passion for the weh on Agna’s nose.

Oh, with our friendships that we did the same,
And screened our blindness under virtue's name Ξ
For we are bound to treat a friend35 defect

With touch most tendet, and a fond respect:
Even as a father treats a child's‚ who hints,

The urchin’s eyes are roguish, if he squints ε

Or if he be as stunted, short, and thick,

As Sisyphus the dwarf, will call him ⁸ chick !’

If crooked all ways, in back, in legs, and thighs,
With sostening phrases will the flaw disguise.
So, if onefriend too close a fist betrays,

Let us ascribe it to his frugal ways;

Or is another—such we often find-

To flippant jest and braggart talk inclined,

'Tis only from a kindly wish vo try

To make the time 'mongst friends go lightly by ;
Another's tongue is rough and over-free,

Let's call it bluntness and sincerity3

To a fallen T ree.

No mortal due provision makes

'Gainst ills which any hour may fa113

The Carthaginian sailor quakes
To think of a Levantine squall,

But feels no terror for the fate,
That elsewhere may his' bark await.

Our soldiers dread the arrows sped
By Parthians shooting as they flee ;

And in their turn the Parthians dread
The chains and keeps of Italy3

But death will tear, as now it tears‚

Whole nations down at unawares.

How nearly in her realms of gloom
I dusky Proserpine had seen,
Seen AEacus dispensing doom,
And the Elysian fields serene,
Heard Sappho to her lute complain
Of unrequited passion's pain;

Heard thee, too, O Alcaeus, tell,
Striking the while thy golden lyre,
With fuller note and statelier swell,
The sorrows and disasters dire
Of warfare and the ocean deep,
And those that far in exile weep.

[Boox 11.

While shades round either singer ὤτους,

And the deserved tribute pay
Of sacred silence to their songs*
Yet chiefly crowd to hear the lay
Of battles old to story known,
And haughty tyrants overthrown.

⁴* ‘¹ Worthy of sacred silence to be heard.''

—Paradise Lost, v, 555.

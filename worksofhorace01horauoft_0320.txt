128 . To M aeoenas, [Boon 111.

'Twas by bribes the Macedonian city's gates could open fling‚
’Twas by bribes that he subverted many a dreaded rival king3
N ay, there lies such fascination in the gleam of gold to some,
That our bluffest navy-captains to its witchery succumb.

But as wealth into our coffers flows in still increasing stote,
So, too, still our care increases, and the hunger still for more?e
Therefore, Ο Maecenas, glory of the knights, with righteous

dread, v
Have Ι ever shrunk from lifting too conspicuously my head.
YeS‚ the more a man, believe me, shall unto himself deny,
So to him shall the Immortals bounteously the more supply.
From the ranks of wealth deserting, Ι, of all their trappings
bare,
To the camp of those who covet nought that pelf can bring
repair,
More illustrious as the master of my poor despised hoard,
Than if Ι should be reputed in my garners to have stored
All the fruits of all the labours of the stout Apulian boor,
Lord belike of wealth unbounded, yet as veriest beggar poor.

In my crystal stream, my woodland, though its acres are

but few,

And the trust.that Ι shall gather home my crops in season due,

Lies a joy, which he may never grasp, who rules in gorgeous
State

Fertile Africa's dominions. Happier, happier sar my fate!

Though for me no bees Calabrian store their honey, nor doth
wine ⁴

Sickening in the Laestrygonian amphora for me refine3

Though for me no flocks unnumbered, browsing Gallia's pas-
tures fair,

Pant beneath their swelling fleeceS, 1 at least am free from care ;

’θ “ And store of cares doth follow riches' store.''
——Fairy Queen, vr. ix. 21.

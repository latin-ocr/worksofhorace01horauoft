ODE XXIX.
'ro MAECENAS.

CION of Tuscan kings, in store
I’ve laid a cask of mellow wine,
That never has been broached before.
I've roseS, too, for wreaths to twine‚
And Nubian nut, that for thy hair

An oil shall yield of fragrance rare.

Then linger not, but hither wend!
Nor always from afar survey

Dank Tibur's leafy heights, my friend,
The sloping lawns of AEsula,

And mountain peaks of Circe’s son,

The parricidal Telegon.

The plenty quit, that only palls,
And, turning from the cloud-capped pile,
That towers above thy palace hans,
Forget to worship sor a while
The privileges Rome enjoyS‚
Her smoke, her splendour, and her noise.

It is the rich who relish best
To dwell at times from state aloof‚
And simple suppers, neatly dressed,
Beneath a poor man's humble roof,
With neither pall nor purple there,
Have smoothed ere now the brow of care.

ODE XV.
To AUGUSTUS.

TO vanquished town and battle fray
I wished to dedicate my lay,
When Phoebus smote his lyre, and sang,
And in his strain this warning rang:
“ Spread not your tiny sails to sweep
The surges of the Tyrrhene deep 1⁷²

Thy era, Caesar, which doth bless
Our plains anew with fruitfulneSS‚
Back to our native skies hath borne
Our standards from the temples torn
Of haughty Parthia, and once more,
The hurricane of warfare o'er,

Hath closed Quirinian Janus’ fane,

ι On lawless licence cast a rein,

And, purging all the land from crime,
Recalled the arts of olden time3

Those arts‚ by which the name and power
of Italy grew hour by hour,

And Rome’s renown and grandeur spread
To sunrise from Sol’s western bed.

While Caesar mles, no civil jar,
Nor violence our ease shall mar,
Nor rage, which swords sor carnage whets‚
And feuds 'twixt hapless towns begets.
The Julian Edicts who shall break?
Not they, who in the Danube slake

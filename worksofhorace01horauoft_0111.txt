His Epode to Neoera. cvii

Yet shall thy heart, Neaera, bleed for this,
For if in Flaccus aught of man remain,
Give thou another j0ys that once were his,
Some other maid more true shall soothe his pain 3
Nor think again to lure him to thy heart!
The paug once felt, his love is past recall ;
And thou, more favoured youth, whoe’er thou art,
Who revell'st now in triumph o'er his fall,
Though thou be rich in land and golden stote,
In lore a sage, with shape framed to beguile,
Thy heart shall ache when, this bn'ef fancy o'er,
She seeks a new love, and Ι calmly smne-'⁵

This is the poetry of youth, the passion of wounded
vanity 3 but it is clearly the product of a strong personal
feeling—a feeling which has more often found expression
in poetry than the higher emotions of those with whom
“love is love for evermore,'’ and who have infinite pity,
but no rebuke, for faithlessneSS. The lines have been
often imitated 3 and in Sir Robert Aytoun's poem on
“Woman's Inconstancy,'' the imitation has a charm not
inferior to the original.
‘¹ Yet do thou glory in thy choice,
Thy choice of his good fortune boast;
1⁹11 neither grieve nor yet rejoice
To see him gain what 1 have lost ;
The height of my disdain shall be
To laugh at him, to blush for thee ;

To love thee still, yet go no more
A-begging to a beggar's door.''

Note how Horace deals with the same theme in his
Ode to Pyrrha (Odes, II. 5), famous in Milton's over-
rated translation, and the difference between the young

Α man writing under the smart of wounded feeling, and the

poet calmly though intensely elaborating his subject as a
work of art, becomes at once apparent.

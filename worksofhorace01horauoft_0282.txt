ODE XVIII.
To A MlsER.

ITHIN my dwelling you behold

Nor ivory, nor roof of gold;
There no Hymettian rasters weigh
On columns from far Africa3
Nor Attalus' imperial chair
Have I usurped, a spurious heir,
Nor client dames of high degree
Laconian purples' spin for me 3
But a true heart and genial vein
Of wit are mine, and rich men deign‚
Poor as I arn, to seek my door.
For nought beyond do I implore
The gods, nor crave my potent friend
A larger bounty to extend,
With what he gave completely blest‚
My happy little Sabine nest.

Day treads down day, and sinks amain,
And new moons only wax to wane,
Yet you, upon death's very brink,
Of piling marbles only think,
That yet are in the quarry's womb,
And, all unmindful of the tomb‚
Rear gorgeous mansions everywhere;
Nay, as though earth too bounded were,
With bulwarks huge thrust back the sea,
That chafes and breaks on Baiae.

lvi sze of Horace.

how people sared in travelling by canal in those dayS‚
near Rome. Overcrowding, we see, is not an evil pecu-
liar to our own days,

“ Now 'gan the night with gentle hand
To sold in shadows all the land,
And stars along the sky to scatter,
When there arose a hideous datter,
Slaves slanging bargemen, bargemen slaves;
¹ Ho, haul up here ! how now, ye knaves,
Inside three hundred people stuff Ρ
Already there are quite enough 1’
collected were the fares at last,
Τὴε mule that drew our barge made fast,
But not till a good hour was gone.
Sleep was not to be thought upon.
The cursed gnats were so provoking,
The buli-frogs set up such a croaking.
A bargeman, too. a drunken lout,
And passenger‚ sang turn about,
In tones remarkable sor strength,
Their absent sweethearts, till at length
The passenger began to doze,
When up the stalwart bargemen rose,
His fastenings from the stone unwound,
And left the mule to graze around3
Then down upon his back he lay.
And snored in a terrific way.”

N either is the following allusion to the Jews and their
creed without its value, especially when followed, as it
is, by Horace's avowal, almost in the words of Lucretius
(B. VI. 56), of what was then his own. Later in life he
came to a ivery different conclusion. When the travel-
lers reach Egnatia, their ridicule is excited by being
shown or told, it is not very clear which, of incense
kindled in the temple there miraculously without the
application of fire.

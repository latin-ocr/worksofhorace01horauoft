> While she bends down her throat to your burning kiss,
Or, fondly cruel, the joy denies you, ’
She'd have you snatch‚ or at times the bliss
Herself will snatch‚ and with joy surprise you?

ODE XIII.

ΤΟ THE TREE ΒΥ WHOSE FALL HIS LIFE WAS
ENDANGERED.

HOE’ER he waS, (his name be banned ἱ)
In evil hour he planted thee,
And with a sacrilegious hand
He nursed, and trained thee up to be
The bane of his succeeding race, '
And of our hamlet the disgrace.

He strangled‚ ay, and with a zest,

His very father, and at dead
Of night stole in upon his guest,

And stabbed him sleeping in his bed 3
Brewed Colchian poisons in his time,
And practised every sort of crime.

All this he must have done—or could—
I’m sure,—the wretch, that stuck thee down,
Thou miserable stump of wood,
To topple on thy master-'s crown,
Who ne'er designed thee any harm,
Here on my own, my savourite farm.

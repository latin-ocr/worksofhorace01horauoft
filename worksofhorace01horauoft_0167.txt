Divus A ugustus. clxiii

· Roman populace—a direct descent from Alma Venus

Gem’z‘nbc, as Antony did from Hercules Altars and
temples were dedicated to great statesmen and generals;
and the RomanS, among the other things which they
borrowed from the East‚ borrowed also the practice of
conferring the honours of apotheosis upon their rulerS‚-
the visible agentS, in their estimation, of the great invis-
ible power that governed the world. To speak of their
divine descent and attributes became part of the common
forms of the poetical vocabulary‚ not inappropriate to the
exalted pitch of lyrical enthusiasm. Horace only falls
into the prevailing strain, and is not compromising him-
self by servile flattery, as some have thought, when he
speaks in this Ode of Augustus as “from gods benign
descended,'' and in others as “the heaven-sent son of
Maia ” (Ι. 2), or as reclining among the gods and quaf-
fing nectar “with lip of deathless bloom’' (ΙΙΙ. 3). In
lyrical poetry all this was quite in place. But when the
poet contracts his wingS, and drops from its empyrean to
the level of the earth, he speaks to Augustus and of him
simply as he thought (Epistles, ΙΙ. 1)—as a man on
whose shoulders the weight of empire rested‚ who pro-
tected the commonwealth by the vigour of his armieS‚
and strove to grace it by “ sweeter mannerS, purer laws.”
He adds, it is true,—

‘· You while in life are honoured as divine,
And vows and oaths are taken at your shrine ;
So Rome pays honour to her man of men,
Ne'er seen on earth before, ne'er to be seen again.¹'

But this is no more than a statement of a fact. Altars

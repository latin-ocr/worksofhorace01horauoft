Tlce Praise of Valour.

From his chaste wife's embrace, they say,

And babes, he tore himself away,

As he had forfeited the right

To clasp them as a freeman might;
Then sternly on the ground he bent

His manly brow 3 and so he lent
Decision to the senate's voice,

That paused and wavered in its choice,
And forth the noble exile strode‚

Whilst friends in anguish lined the road.

Noble indeed! for, though he knew
What tortures that barbarian crew
Had ripe for him, he waved aside
The kin that did his purpose chide,
The thronging crowds‚ that strove to stay
His passage, with an air as gay,
As though, at close of some decree
Upon a client's lawsuit‚ he
Its dreary coil were leaving there,
To green Venafrum to repair,
Or to Tarentum's breezy shore,
Where Spartans built their town of yore.

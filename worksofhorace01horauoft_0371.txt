ons xm] To A zcgustm. 1 79

With havoc dire did he
O'erwhelm that banded crowd

Of hearts in stern devotion vowed

To die or to be free!
Like Auster, lashing into ire

The tameless ocean-waves, when through
The driving rack the Pleiad choir

Flash suddenly in view,
So furiously he dashed

Upon his serried foes,

And where the balefires thickest rose,
With foaming war-steed crashed.

As bull-shaped Aufidus, who laves
Apulian Daunus' realm,
Is whirled along, when o’er his banks
He eddies and he raves,
Designing to o'erwhelm
Τ11ε cultured fields with deluge and dismay,
So Claudius swept the iron ranks
Of the barbarian host,
And where from van to rear he clove his way,
’ Along his track the mangled foemen lay,
Nor did one squadron lost
The lustre dim of that victorious fray.

But thine the legions were, and thine
The counsels‚ and the auspices divine,
For on the sels-same day, ’
That suppliant Alexandria had flung·
Her port and empty palace wide to thee,
Did F ortune‚ who since then through lustres three
Had to thy banners smiling clung,
Bring our long wars to a triumphant close,
And sor thee proudly claim

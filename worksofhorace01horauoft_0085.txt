· the Sixth Satire of the Second Book, which has a double

value,-for its biographical detaiIS, and as a specimen of
his best manner in his Satires,

Itis characteristic of Horace that in the very next Satire
he makes his own servant Davus tell him that his rhapso-
dies about the country and its charms are mere humbug,
and that, for all his ridicule of the shortcomings of his
neighbours‚ he is just as inconstant as they are in his
likings and dislikings. The poet in this way lets us see
into his own little vanities, and secures the right by
doing so to rally his friends for theirs. To his valet, at
all eventS, by his own showing, he is no hero.

· ⁴ You’re praisin g up incessantly

The habits, manners, likings, ways,
Of people in the good old days;
Yet should some god this moment give
To you the power, like them to live,
You’re just the man to say, ‘ Ι won’t !’
Because in them you either don’t
Believe‚ or else the courage lack,
The truth through thick and thin to back,

¹ And, rather than its heights aspire, ’
Will go on sticking in the mire.
At Rome you sor the country sigh;
When in the country, to the sky
You, ssighty as the thistle's down,
Are always crying up the town.
If no one asks you out to dine, .
Oh, then the pot-auscu’s divine!
‘ You go out on compulsion only-
’Tis so delightful to be lonely;
And drinking bumpers is a bore
You shrink from daily more and more.
But only let Maecenas send
Command sor you to meet a friend ;
Although the message comes so late,
The lamps are being lighted, straight,

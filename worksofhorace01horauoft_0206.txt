Cive me Anio's headlong torrent,
And Tiburnus' grove and hills,

And its orchards 'sparkling dewy
With a thousand wimpling rills 2

Sweeps the louring clouds away,
Nor with showers unceasing ever
Loads the long and dreary day,
Plancus, so do thou remember
Still to cheer with balmy wine
All the care and grief and travail
Of this toilworn life of thine 3
Whether in the thronged camp, gleaming
With a thousand spears, or laid
On the turf beneath the umbrage ,
Of thy loved Tiburtine glade. ” ’

F irst a wreath of poplar bound,
Then his comrades thus accosted‚
As they sadly stood around:
“ Wheresoever F ortune, kinder
Than my sire, our voyage bends,
Thither shall we go together,
O my comrades, brothers, friends!
Teucer for your leader,—marshalled
Under Teucer's guiding star,
What shall stay, or what shall daunt us?
Hence, then, craven sears, afar Ξ

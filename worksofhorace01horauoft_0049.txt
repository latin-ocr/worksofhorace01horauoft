. dation of VariuS, already celebrated as a writer of epic

poetry, and whose tragedy of “ ThyesteS‚” if we are to
trust Quintilian, was not unworthy to rank with the best
tragedies of Greece. Maecenas may not at first have
been too well disposed towards a follower of the republi-
can party, who had not been sparing of his satire against
many of the supporters and favourites of Octavius He
sent for Horace, however (nc, 39), and any prejudice
on this score, if prejudice there was, was ultimately got
over. Maecenas took time to form his estimate of the
man, and it was not till nine months after their first inter-
view that he sent for Horace again. When he did εο,
however, it was to ask him to consider himself for the
future among the number of his friends, This part of
Horace's story is told with admirable brevity and good
feeling in the Satire from which we have already quoted,
addressed to Maecenas (Β. Ῑ. Sat. 6) a few years after-
wardS.

‘⁸ Lucky 1 will not call myself, as though
Thy friendship 1 to mere good fortune owe.
No chance it was secured me thy regards, -
But Virgil first, that best of men and bards,
And then kind Varius mentioned what I was.
Before you brought, with many a faltering pause,
Dropping some few brief words (for bashfulness
Robbed me of utterance), I did not profess
That 1 was sprung of lineage old and great,
Or used to canter round my own estate
On Satureian barb, but what and who
I was as plainly told. As usual, you
Brief answer make me. Ι retire, and then,
Some nine months after, summoning me again,
You bid me 'mongst your friends assume a place :
And proud 1 feel that thus 1 won your grace,
Not by an ancestry long known to same,
But by my life, and heart devoid of blame.”

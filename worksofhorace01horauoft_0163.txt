Ode to Iulus Antonius. clix

· plished triumphantly (13.c. 17) 3 and we may assume that
the Ode was written while the tidings of his success were
still fresh, and the RomanS, who had been greatly agi-
tated by the defeat of Lollius, were looking eagerly
forward to his return. Apart from its other meritS, the
Ode is interesting from the estimate Horace makes in it
of his own powerS‚ and his avowal of the labour which
his verses eost him.

“ Iulus, he who’d rival Pindar’s fame,
On waxen wings doth sweep
Τὴε Empyrean steep,
To fall like Icarus, and with his name
Endue the glassy deep.

Like to a mountain stream, that roars
From bank to bank along.
When autumn rains are strong,

So deep-mouthed Pindar lifts his voice, and pours
His fierce tumultuous song.

Worthy Apollo’s laurel wreath‚
Whether he strike the lyre
To love and young desire,

While bold and lawless numbers grow beneath
His mastering touch of fire· ‚

'Or sings of gods, and monarchs sprung
Of gods, that overthrew
The Centaurs, hideous crew,

And, fearless of the monster's fiery tongue,
The dread Chimaera slew3

Or those the Elean palm doth list
To heaven, for winged steed,
Or stus-dy arm decreed,

Giving, than hundred statues nobler gift,
The poet's deathless meed;

Or mour-ns the youth snatched from his bride,
Extols his manhood clear,
And to the starry sphere

Exalts his golden virtues, scattering wide
The gloom of Orcus drear.

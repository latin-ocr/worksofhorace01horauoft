64 To Dellius. Δ [BOOK 11.

There wine, there perfumes bring, ,
Bringg aarlands of the rose,

F a1r and too short· lived daughter of the spring,
While youth's bright current flows

Within thy veins,—ere yet hath corne the hour,

When the dread sisters three shall clutch thee 1n their
power. ἥ

Thy woods, thy treasured pride,
Thy mansion's pleasant seat,

Thy lawns washed by the Tiber’s yellow tide,
Each favourite retreat,

Thou must leave all—all, and thine heir shall run
In riot through the wealth thy years of toil have won.†

ὓ ¹‘ Collzgffi virgo, rosas, dumflos novus et nova pubes,
Et memor esto aevum sic properare tuum.'·

—Ausomua
“ Gather therefore the rose, while yet is prime,
For soon comes Age, that will her pride deflower ;
Gather the rose of love, while yet is time,

Whilst loving thou mayst loved be with equa] crime.”
—SPENSER.

¹¹ Festinat enim decurrere velox
Flosculus augustae miseroeque brevissima vitoe

Fortia,- dum bibimus, dum serta, unguenta, puellas
Poscimus, obrepit non intellecta senectusf

—JUVENAL, rx. 125.

“ For youth, too ‘transient flowerl of lise's short day
The shortest part, but blossoms——to deoey.
Lo l while we give the unregarded honr
To revelry and joy, in Ploesure’s bower,
While now for rosy wreaths our brows to twine,
And now for nymphs we call, and now sor wine,
The noiselaes soot of Time steals swiftly by,

And ere we dream of manhood‚ age is nighl·
-Gmronn' s Translation.

†‘ ‘Why dost thou haep up wealth, which thou must quit,
Or, what is worse, be left by it ?

Why dost thou load thyself‚ when thou⁸rt to ily,
Ο man ordained to die?

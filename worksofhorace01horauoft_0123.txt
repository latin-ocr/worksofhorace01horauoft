Horace and L 3]εὲ. cxix

Where now that beauty ? Where those movements Ρ Where

That colour? What os her, of her is lest,
who, breathing Love's own air,
Me of myself bet-eft,

Who reigned in Cinara's stead, a fair, fair sace,
Queen of sweet arts? But Fate to Cinara gave
¹ A life of little space3

And now she cheats the grave

Of Lyce, spared to raven's length of days,

That youth may see, with laughter and disgust‚
A firebrand, once ablaze,

Now smouldering in grey dust.''—(Conington.)

What had this wretched Lyce done that Horace should
have prayed the gods to strip her of her charmS‚ and to
degrade her from a haughty beauty into a maudlin hag,
disgusting and ridiculous? Why cast such very merciless
stones at one wh0, by his own avowal, had erewhile
witched his very soul from him? Why rejoice to see
this once beautiful creature the scoff of all the heartless
young fops of Rome? If she had injured him, what
’ of that? Was it so very strange that a woman trained,
like all the class to which she belonged, to be the
plaything of man's caprice, should have been —fickle‚ mer-
cenary, 'or even heartless? Poor Lyce might at least
have> claimed his silence, if he could not d0‚ what Thack-
eray says every honest fellow should d0‚ ‘⁶ think well of
the woman he has once thought well of, and remember
her with kindness and tenderneSS‚ as a man remembers a
place where he has been very happy.”

Horace’s better self comes out in his playful appeal to
his friend Xanthias (odes, ΙΙ. 4) not to be ashamed of
having fallen in love with his handmaiden Phyllis. That
she is a slave is a matter of no account. A girl of such
admirable qualities must surely come of a good stock‚

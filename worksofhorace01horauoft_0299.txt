Unto great Caesar’s self ye lend new life
In grot Pierian,⁴wh'en
He has disposed his men

Among the townS, to rest from battle-strife,
And yearns for peace again.

From you flow gentle counsels, and most dear
Such counsels are to you.
We know, how He o’erthrew

By His down-swooping bolts those monsters drear,
The impious Titan crew;

Who doth the dull and sluggish earth control,
The tempest-shaken main,
Thronged towns, the realms of pain .
And gloom, and doth with even justice sole
O'er gods and mortals reign.

When he beheld them first, these brothers stark,
Proud in their strength of arm,
Crowding in hideous swarm

To pile up Pelion on Olympus dark,
Jove shuddered with alarrn.

But what could stout Typhoeus, Mimas do? .
Or what, for all his might,
Porphyrion’s threatening height,

What ProetuS, or Enceladus, that threw
Uprooted trees, in fight

Against great Pallas' ringing aegis dashed‚
What could they all essay?
Here, eager for the stay,

Stood Vulcan, there dame Juno unabashed,
And he who ne’er doth lay

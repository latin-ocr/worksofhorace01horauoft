Ode to Augustus. clxi

Horned like the moon, when her pale light
Which three brief days have fed,
She trimmeth, and dispread

On his broad brows a spot of snowy white,
All else a tawny red.''

Augustus did not return from Gaul, as was expected
when this Ode was written, but remained there for about
two year’s. That this protracted absence caused no little

disquietude in Rome is apparent from the following Ode
(IV. 5) :—-

“ From gods benign descended‚ thou
Best guardian of the fates of Rome,
Too long already from thy horne
Hast thou, dear chief, been absent now;

Oh, then return, the pledge redeem,
Thou gav'st the Senate, and once more
Its light to all the land restore;

For when thy sace, like spring-tide’s gleam,

Its brightness on the people sheds,
Then glides the day more sweetly by,
A brighter blue pervades the sky,

The sun a richer radiance spreads !

As on her boy the mother calls,
Her boy, whom envious tempests keep
Beyond the vexed Carpathian deep,
From his dear home, till winter falls,

And stin with vow and prayer she cries,
Stin gazes on the winding shore,
So yearns the country evermore

For Caesar, with fond, wistful eyes.

For safe the herds range field and fen,

Fun-headed stand the shocks of grain,
Our sailors sweep the paecesul main,
And man can trust his fellow-men.

No more adulterers stain our beds,
Laws, morals, both that taint efface,
The husband in the child we trace,

And close on crime sure vengeance treads.

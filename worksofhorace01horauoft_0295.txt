one ιιι] ” ΤΙῑε Apotheosis of Romulus. 103

“ Troy doomed to perish in its pride
> By chaste Minerva and by me,
Her people, and their guileful guide,
Since false Laomedon denied

The gods their promised see.

“ The Spartan wanton’s shameless guest
No longer flaunts in brave array,
Nor screened by Hector’s valiant breast
Doth Priam's perjured house arrest
My Argives in the sray.

“ Protracted by our feuds no more,
The war is quelled. So 1 abate

Mine anger, and to Mars restore

Him, whom the Trojan priestess bore,
The grandchild of my hate.

“ Him will I suffer to attain

These realms of light, these blest abodes,
The juice of nectar pure to drain,
And be enrolled amid the train Ι

Of the peace-breathing gods.

“As long as the broad rolling sea
Shall roar ’twixt Ilion and Rome,

Where'er these wandering exiles be,

There let them rule, be happy, free3
Whilst Priam’s‚ Paris' tomb

“ Is trodden o'er by roving kine,
And wild beasts there securely breed,
The Capitol afar may shine,
And Rome, proud Rome, her laws assign
Unto the vanquished Mede.

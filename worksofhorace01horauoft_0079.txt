We have a fountain, too, that well may claim

To give the stream, whose source it is, a name 3
More cool, more clear, not Thracian Hebrus flows,
Balm for head-pains, and for the stomach's woes.
This dear, yea truly exquisite, retreat

Keeps me in health through even September's heat.''

Here is what a tourist found it in 1869 ε ¹-—

¹⁸ Following a path along the brink of the torrent Digen-
tia, we passed a towering rock, on which once stood Vacu-
na's shrine, and entered a pastoral region of well-watered
meadow-lands, enamelled with flowers and studded with
chestnut and fruit trees. Beneath their sheltering shade
peasants were whiling away the noontide hours. Here sat
Daphnis piping sweet witching melodies on a reed to his
rustic Phidyle, whilst Lydia and she wove wreaths of wild-
flowers, and Lyce sped down to the edge of the stream and
brought us cooling drink in a bulging conca borne on her
head. Its waters were as deliciously refreshing as they
could have been when the poet himself gratefully recorded
how often they revived his strength: and one longed to
think, and hence half believed, that our homely Hebe, like
her fellows, was sprung from the coloni who tiued his
fields and dwelt in the five homesteads of which he sings.
. Near the little village of Licenza, standing like its
lostier neighbour, Civitella, on a steep hill at the foot of
Lueretilis, we turned off the path, crossed a thiekly wooded
knoll, and came to an orchard, in which two young labour-
ers were at work. We asked where the remains of Horace’s
sarm were. ‘A pi? tuz’J’ answered the nearest of them,
in a dialect more like Latin than Italian. So saying, he
began with a shovel to uncover a massive floor in very fair
preservation ; a little sarther on was another, crumbling to
pieces. Chaupy has luckily saved one all doubt as to the

y site of the farm, establishing to our minds convincingly

’ that it could scarcely have stood on ground other than that

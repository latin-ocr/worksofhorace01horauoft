Nor Persian, practised in deecit,
Nor all the ruthless tribes, beside
The Danube's darkly·rolling tide.

And we, on working days and all
Our days of feast and festival,
Shall with our wives and children there,
Approaching first the Gods in prayer,
Whilst jovial Bacchus' gifts we pour,
Sing, as our fathers sang of yore,
To Lybian fluteS, which answer round,
Of chiefs for mighty worth renowned,
Of Troy, Anchises, and the line
Of Venus evermore benign!

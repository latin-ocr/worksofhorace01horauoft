ODE IV.
To sEs‘rms.

AS biting Winter flies, lo, Spring with sunny skies,
And balmy airs! and barks long dry put out again
from shore3
Now the ox forsakes his byre, and the husbandman his fire,
And daisy·dapp1ed meadows bloom where winter frosts
lay hoarfi‘·

By Cytherea led, while the moon‘shines overhead‚
The Nymphs and Graces, hand in hand, with alternating
feet ν .
Shake the ground‚vwhile swinking Vulcan strikes the sparkles
fierce and red
From the forges of the Cyclops, with reiterated beat.

'Tis the time with myrtle green to bind our glistening locks‚
Or with flowers, wherein the loosened earth herself hath
newly dressed,
And to sacrifice to Faunus in some glade amidst the rocks
A yearling lamb, or else a kid, if such delight him best.

Death comes alike to all-—to the monarch's lordly hall,
Or the hovel of the beggar, and his summons none shall stay.
O Sestius, happy Sestius Ξ use the moments as they pass ;
F ar-reaching hopes are not for us, the creatures of a day.

ὕ “Joyous, the impatient husbandman perceives
Relenting Nature, and his lusty steers
Drives from their stalls, to where the well-used plough
Lies in the furrow, loosened from the frost.’'
—THOMSON’S Seasons .· “ Spring. '⁸

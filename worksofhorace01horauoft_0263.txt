Or simple myrtle ? Whom will Venus send
To rule our revel ? Wild my draughts shall be
As Thracian Bacchanals', for 'tis sviteet to me,
To lose my wits, when Ι regain my friend.

ODE VIII.

TO BARINE.

F e’ er, in vengeance for thy saithlessness,

Heaven had but made thy charms one charm the less,
Blackened one tooth, or tarnished one bright nail,
Then I, Barine, might believe thy tale.
But soon as thou hast laid all kinds of vows
And plighted oaths on those perfidious brows,
Thy beauty heightens into rarer dies,
And all our young men haunt thy steps with severish eyes,

It profits thee, fair mischief, thus to spurn

The deep vows plighted by thy mother's urn,

By all the silent stars that gem the night,

And by the gods, whom death may never blight.
Venus herself doth smile to hear thee swear‚

Smile the sweet nymphs beneath their sunny hair3
And Cupid, unrelenting boy, doth smile,

Pointing on gory stone his burning shafts the while.

To thee our youth's best flowcr in homage kneels,
New slaves bend daily at thy chariot-wheels ;
And they, who oft have sworn to haunt no more
Thy fatal home, still linger as before.

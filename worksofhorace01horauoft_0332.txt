140 To Venus. [Boox 111.

No mean, no mortal theme is mine,
Nor less my numbers than divine!
Though peribus, 'tis glorious too,

O great Lenaeus, to pursue

The god, who round his forehead hwines
Leaves gathered freshly from the vines!

ODE XXVI.
To vENUS.

I'VE had of late a host of loves afoot‚
And triumphs too might brag of more than one,
But now Ι hang up here my arms and lute,
With the fatigues of the campaign fordone.

Quick‚ quick! Beside them pile here on the wall,
That to the lest doth sea-born Venus guard,

Links, crowbars, hatchets, bows, the terrors all
Of doors, that were to my beseechings ban-ed!

Thou, of fair Cyprus who queen goddess art,
And Memphis, which no Thracian snows enwrap,
Wave high thy scourge, appal proud Chloe's heart,
And give her—just one little tiny tap.*

* Landor had this last verse in view in the following poem ε·-

’· So late removed from him she swore,
With clasping arms and vows and taerS.
In life and death she would adore,
While memory, fondness, bliss endoers.

‘⁴ Can she forswear, can she forget ἶ
Strike, mighty Love! Strike, Vengffineel Sost!
Conscience must come, and bring regret :
These let her feel! . . . Nor these too oft!''

Horace and Lydia. cxi

the prepossession which the constant mention of it as a
dialogue between Horace and Lydia makes it difficult to
avoid, the Ode commends itself merely as a piece of
graceful fancy. Real feeling is the last thing one looks
for in two such excessively well-bred and fickle person-
ages as the speakers. Their pouting and reconciliation
make very pretty fooling, such as might be appropriate
in the wonderful beings who people the garden land-
scapes of Watteau. But where are the fever and the
strong pulse of passion which, in less ethereal morta18‚
would be proper to such a theme? Had there been a
real lady in the case, the tone would have been less
measured, and the strophes less skilfully balanced.

HonACE.

‘⁸ Whilst Ι to thee was dean
And yet no arm but mine
Might clasp that neck of thine‚ ’

Not Persia's monarch, high on throne, would 1 have owned my peer.

Lva.

Whilst yet no other girl
More fired thee, nor the face
Of Lydia gave to Chloe's place.
Not Roman Ilia shone as peer to me of maids the pearl.

HORACE.

Apt at the lyre and song,
Now Chloe is my queen;
For her. sor her—but sear or teen—
I'd give my life, could thus my love her dearer lise prolong.

LYmA.

Calais, sweet Thurian boy,
Beloved, is now my lover·—
γ For him, sor him, for him twice over, ·
Isso were span-ed his dearer life, my life I'd give with joy.

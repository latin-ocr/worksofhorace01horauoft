Belz'ef in a Hereafter. ‹ cxli

Thee soon shall night enshroud; and the Manes· phantom crowd,
And the starveling house unbeautiful of Pluto shut thee in ;
And thou shalt not banish care by the ruddy wine-cup there,
Nor woo the gentle Lycidas, whom all are mad to win.''

A modern would no more think of using such images
as those of the last two verses to stimulate the festivity
of his friends than he would of placing, like the old
Egyptians, a skull upon his dinner—table, or of decorating
his ball-room with Holbein's “Dance of Death.'' We
rebuke our pride or keep our vanities in check by the
thought of death, and our poets use it to remind us that

“⁸ The glories of our blood and state
Are shadows‚ not substantial things.”

Horace does this too 3 but out of the sad certainty of
mortality he seems to extract a keener zest for the too
brief enjoyment of the flying hours. Why is this Ρ Pro-
bably because by the pagan mind life on this side the
'grave was regarded as a thing rnore preciOUS, more noble,
than the life beyond. That there was a life beyond was
undoubtedly the general belief. “ Sunt aliquid Manes ,-
letum non omnia finit, Luridaque evictas effugit umbra
rogos,”-

“ The Manes are no dream ; death closes not ζ
Our all of being, and the wan-visaged shade κ’
Eseapes unscathed from the funereal fircs,'' (χ

says Propertius (Eleg. IV. 7) 3 and unless this were 50,
there would be no meaning whatever in the whole pagan
idea of Hades-—in the “domus exilis Plutonia ,· '' in the
‚Hermes driving the spirits of the dead across the Styx ς

in the “ judicantem AEacum, sedesque discretas piorum ''—

the “AEacus dispensing doom, and the Elysian Fields

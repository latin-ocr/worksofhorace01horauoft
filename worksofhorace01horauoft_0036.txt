xxxii Lzse of Horace.

except as showing how badly even Horace could write,
and how sedulously the better feeling and better taste
of his riper years led him to avoid that most worthless
form of satire which attacks where rej0inder is impos-
sible, and irritates the temper but cannot possibly amend
the heart. In others, the lash is applied with no less
justice than vigour, as in the following invective, the
fourth of the Epodes :—

“ Such hate as nature meant to be
'Twixt lamb and wolf 1 feel for thee,
Whose hide by Spanish scourge is tanned,
And legs still bear the setter's brand ἔ
Though of your gold you strut so vain.
Wealth cannot change the knave in grain.
How l see you not, when stn‘ding down
The Via Sacra1 in your gown
Good six ells wide, the passers there
Turn on you with indignant stare?
‘ This wretch,' such gibes your ear invade,
‘ By the Triumvirs‘2 scourges flayed,
Till even the crier shirked his toil,
Some thousand acres ploughs of soil
Falernian, and with his nags
Wears out the Appian highway’s flags;
Nay‚ on the foremost seats‚ despite
Of Oth0‚ sits and apes the knight.
What boots it to despatch a fleet
So large, so heavy, so complete,
Against a gang of rascal knaves,
Thieves‚ corsairs, buccaneers, and slaves.
If villain of such vulgar breed
Is in the foremost rank to lead?' '⁹

Modern critics may differ as to whom this bitter in-

1 The Sacred Way, leading to the Capitol. a favoni-ite lounge.

2 When a slave was being scourged, under the orders of the Trium-
viri Capitales, a public crier stood by, and proclaimed the nature of his
cnme.

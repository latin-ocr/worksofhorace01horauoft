CHAPTER IX.

HORACE’S RELATmNs WITH Aucusws.—ffls LOVE
or INDEPENDENCE.

No intimate friend of Maecenas was likely to be long a
stranger to Augustus3 and it is most improbable that
AugustUS, who kept up his love of good literature amid
all the distractions of conquest and empire, should not
have early sought the acquaintance of a man of such
conspicuous ability as Horace. But when they first
became known to each other is uncertain. In more
than one of the Epodes Horace speaks of him, but not
in terms to imply personal acquaintance. Some years
further on it is different. When Trebatius (SatireS‚
ΙΙ. 1) is urging the poet, if write he must, to renounce
satire, and to sing of Caesar’s triumphs, from which he
would reap gain as well as glory, Horace replieS,—

‘¹ Most worthy sir, that's just the thing
I'd like especially to sing3
But at the task my spirits faint,
For 'tis not every one can paint
Battalions, with their bristling wall
Of pikes, and make you see the Gaul,
With shivered spear, in death-throe bleed,
Or Parthian stricken from his steed.”

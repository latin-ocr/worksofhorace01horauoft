1 16 TO Α εἶενίὲ. [Boox 111.

Of Peleus then he tells, who thus
Was nigh consigned to Tartarus,
Because his coldness shamed ,
Magnessia's queen Hippolyte,
And hints at stories craftily
To sap his virtue framed.

In vain Ξ For he, untouched as yet,
Is deafer than the rocks that fret
The Icarian waves 3-but thou,
Keep watch upon thy fancy t00‚
Nor to Enipeus there undue
Attractiveness allow!

Though no one on the Martian Mead

Can turn and wind a mettledhsteed
So skilfully as he,

Nor any breast the Tuscan tide,

And dash its tawny waves aside
With such celerity.

At nightfall shut your doorS‚ nor then

Look down into the street again,
When quavering fifes complain3

And though he call thee, as he will,

Unjust, unkind, unfeeling, still
Inflexible remain!

lxxii szfe of Horace.

Enjoying all home's simple luxury.

This is the lise of bard unclogged, like me,

By stem ambition's miserable weight.

So placed, I own with gratitude, my state

Is sweeter, ay, than though a quaestor’s power
From sire and grandsire's sires had been my dower.''

It would not have been easy to bribe a man of these
simple habits and tasteS, as some critics have contended
that Horace was bribed‚ to become the laureate of a
party to which he had once been opposed, even had
Maecenas wished to do so. His very indifference to
those favours which were within the disposal of a great
minister of state, placed him on a vantage-ground in his
relations with Maecenas which he could in no other way
have secured. Nor, we may well believe, would that
distinguished man have wished it otherwise. Sur-
rounded as he was by servility and selfish baseneSS, he
must have felt himself irresistibly drawn towards a nature
so respectful, so affectionate, yet perfectly manly and
independent, as that of the poet. Nor can we doubt
that intimacy had grown into friendship, warm and sin-
cere, before he gratified his own feelingS, while he made
Horace happy for life, by presenting him with a small
estate in the Sabine country—a gift which, we may be
sure, he knew well would be of all gifts the most wel-
come. It is demonstrable that it was not given earlier
than 13.c. 33, or after upwards of four years of intimate
acquaintance. That Horace had longed for such a pos-
session, he tells us himself (SatireS, ΙΙ. 6). He had pro-
’ bably expressed his longing in the hearing of his friend,
and to such a friend the opportunity of turning the poet's
dream into a reality must have been especially delightful.

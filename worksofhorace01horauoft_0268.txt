To Licinius. [Boox 11.

A change no less will sear:
If haggard winters o’er the land

By Jove are spread, at his command
In time they disappeart*

Though now they may, be sure of this,
Things will not always go amiss;
Not always bends in ire
2 Apollo his dread bow, but takes
The lyre, and from her trance awakes
The Muse with touch of fire.

Though sorrows strike‚ and comrades shrink‚
Yet never let your spirits sink,
But to yourself be true ;
So wisely, when yourself you find
Scudding before too sair a wind,
” Take in a reef or two.†

÷÷ “ The darkest day,
Live till to-morrow‚ will have passed away.''

—Cowpma

Ἰ- “ Tu quoque formida nimium sublimia semper,-
Propositiquc memor, contrahe vela, tui.''

——Ovrn, Tristia, 111. 4. 31.

“ But ever hold too soaring thoughts in faer,
And, mindful os your purpose, furl your sails.''

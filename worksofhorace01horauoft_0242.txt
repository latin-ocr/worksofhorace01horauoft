ODE XXXIII.
To ALssms TIBULLUS.

AY, Albius, a truce to this sighing and grieving Σ
Is Glycera worth all this torture of hrain?
Why flatter her, lachrymose elegies weaving,
Because she is false for a youthfuller swain?

There's Lycoris, the maid with the small rounded sorehead,

For Cyrus is wasting by inches away,
Whilst for Pholoe he, with a passion as torrid,
Consumes, and to him she'll have nothing to say.

The she-goats, in fact, might be sooner expected
Apulia's wolves for their partners to take,

Than a girl so divine to be ever connected
With such an abandoned and pitiful rake.

Such caprices hath Venus, who, rarely propitious‚
Delights in her setters os iron to bind

Those pairs whom she sees, with a pleasure malicious,
Unrnatched both in fortune, and figure, and mind.

I myself, wooed by one that was truly a jewel,
In thraldom was held, which 1 cheerfully bore,
By that vulgar thing, Myrtale, though she was cruel
As waves that indent the Calabrian shore.

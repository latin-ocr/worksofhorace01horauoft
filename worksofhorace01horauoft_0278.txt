To Grosphus. [Boox 11.

Why should we still project and plan,

We creatures of an hour?

Why fly from clime to clime‚ new regions scour?
Where is the exile, who, since time began,

To fly from sels had powerfl·

Fell Care climbs brazen galleys’ sides 3

Nor troops of horse can fly

Her foot, which than the stag’s is swifter‚ ay,
Swifter than Eurus, when he madly rides

The clouds along the sky.

Careless what lies beyond to know,
And turning to the best
The present, meet life's bitters with a jest‚
And srnile them down ; since nothing here below
Is altogether blest.†

In manhood's prime'Achilles died,
Tithonus by the slow
Decay of age was wasted to a show,
And Time may what it hath to thee denied
On nie, perchance, bestow. ’

⁴⁶ ‘⁴ Our sorrows still pursue us ς and when you

The ruined Capitol shall view,
And statues, a disordered heap, you can
Not cure yet the disease of man,
And banish your own thoughts. Ge, travel where
Another sun and stars appmr,
And land not touched by any covetous fleet,
And yet even there yourself you’ll meet.''

-HABmG‘ron’s Castam.

† “Medio de fonte leporum
Surgit amari aliquid, quod ipsis in floribus angit.''
—Lucnss‘rms

“ Full from the fount of joy's delicious springs
Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom 'flings.''
—BYRON.

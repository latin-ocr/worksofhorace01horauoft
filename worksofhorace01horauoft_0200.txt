ODE ΙΙΙ.

ΤΟ THE SHIP IN WHICH VIRGIL WAS ABOUT ΤΟ SAIL
FOR GREECE. ,

M AY the great goddess-queen of Cyprus isle,
⁴2 And Helen's brothers, those twin cressets fair,
And he that rules the winds, propitious smile,
All save Iapyx chaining in their lair,
And govern so thy course, O bark, that thou
Mayest wast in safety to Athene's shore
My Virgil, to thy care intrusted now,
And to its love my soul's dear half restore ἰ

In oak or triple brass his breast was mailed‚
Who first committed to the ruthless deep
His fragile skiff, nor inly shrank and quailed,
To hear the headlong Afric fiercely sweep
With northern blasts to wrestle and to rave,
Nor feared to face the tristful HyadeS‚
And Notus tyrant of the Adrian wave,
That lists, or calms at will the restless seasst‘

¹ What form of death could daunt his soul, who viewed
Ocean’s dread shapes‚ nor turned his eyes away,
Its surging waves, and with disaster strewed
Thy fated rocks, Acroceraunia?

ὕ “ First came great Neptune with his three-forked mace,
That rules the seaS, and makes them rise or fall.'’
’ —Fairy Queen, IV. ii. 2.

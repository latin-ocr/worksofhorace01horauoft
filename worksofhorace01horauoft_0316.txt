ODE XIII.
To THE BANDthxAN FOUNT.

FOU N TAIN of Bandusia's dell,
Than crystal clearer, that of wine
Art worthy, and of flowers as well,
T o·morrow shall be thine

A kid, whose horns just budding, drean
Of love and battles both ! In vain!

For the young rake thy gelid stream
With ruddy gore shall stain.

Gainst flaming Sirius' fury thou

Art proof‚ and grateful cool dost yield
To oxen wearied with the plough,

And flocks that range afield.

Thou too shalt rank with springs renowned,
1 singing, how from umbrage deep

Of caverned rocks, with ilex crowned‚
Thy babbling waters leap-

ουκ 111.] To V irgil ’s Slcip.

Vainly hath Jove in wisdom land from land
By seas dissevered wild and tempest-tossed,
If vessels bound, despite his high command,
‚⁴ O'er waters purposed never to be crossed.

Presumptuous man, in insolence of souI,
Sweeps to his aim through sacrilege and crime ;
Heaven's fire for us the bold Prometheus stole
By fraud unhallowed in the olden time ;
Then wasting agues, hectic severs smote
The earth, and hosts of new-born terrors spread3
And Death‚ till then forgetful and remote,
Quickened his slow, inevitable tread Ξ

On wings that were forbid to mortals durst
Vain Daedalus to cleave the void of air;
Through fateful Acheron Alcides burst:
N ought is too arduous for man to dare.
In our unbounded folly we 'aspire
To heaven itself 3 and such our guilty pride,
We will not let great Jove forget his·> ire,
Nor lay his vengeful thunderbolts aside.

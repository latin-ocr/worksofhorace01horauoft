1 26 To Chloris. [Boon 111.

If aught that held the juice of grape
Might roving Spartacus escape!

N eaera‚ too, that singer rare,

Go, bid her quickly bind her hair,
Her myrrhy hair, in simple knot,
And haste to join me on the spot!
But if her porter say thee nay,

The hateful churl! then come away.
Time-silvered locks the passions school,
And make the testiest brawler cool;
I had not brooked his saucy prate,
When young, in Plancus' consulate.

 

ODE XV.
To anyoms.

UIT‚ quit, 'tis more than time, thou wife
Of Ibycus the pauper,

Thy horribly abandoned life
And courses most improper!

Ripe for the grave, ’mongst girls no more
Attempt to sport thy paces,

Nor fling thy hideous shadow o’er ’
Their pure and starry graces. ,

What charmingly on Pholoe sits
In Chloris must repel us:

Thy daughter better it befits
To hunt up the young sellows.

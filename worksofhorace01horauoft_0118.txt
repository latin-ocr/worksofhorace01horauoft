'cxiv Life of Horace.

‘¹ Then reels my brain, then on my cheek
The shifting colour comes and goes,

And tears, that flow unbidden‚ speak .

lover’s pleasures and pains served to infuse a tone of
kindliness into his ridicule. How charming in this way
is the Ode to Lydia (Ι. 8), of which the late Henry
Luttrel's once popular and still delightful ‘ Letters to

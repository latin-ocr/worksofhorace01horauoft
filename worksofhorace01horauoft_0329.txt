ome. xxm] To tlte Covetous. 1 37

Oh for the man, would stay
Our gory hands, our civil broils allay!
If on his statutes he
SIRE OF THE COMMON-WEAL proclaimed would be,
Let him not sear to rein
Our wild licentiousness, content to gain
From after-times renown,
For ah! while Virtue lives, we hunt her down,

And only learn to prize
Her worth, when she has passed for ever from our eyes!

What boots it to lament‚
1f crime be not cut down by punishment?
What can vain laws avail,
If life in every moral virtue fail?
If nor the clime‚ that glows,
Environed round by fervid heats, nor snows
And biting N orthern wind,
. Which all the earth in icy eerements bind,
The merchant back can keep,
And skilful shipmen flout the horrors of the deep?

Yes! Rather than be poor,

What will not mortals do, what not endure?
Such dread disgrace to shun,

From virtue’s toilsome path away we run.
Quick‚ let us, ’mid the roar

of crowds applauding to the echo, pour
Into the Capitol,

Or down into the nearest ocean roll
Our jewels, gems, and gold,

Dire nutriment of ills and miseries untold!

If with sincere intent
We would of our iniquities repent,

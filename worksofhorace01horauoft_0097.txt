When you're patched up with thirst, and your hunger’s undoubted,
Then spurn simple food if you can, or plain wine,
Which no honeyed gums from Hymettus refine.··

His homily then proceeds in terms which would not be
out of place if addressed to a gourmet of modern London
or Paris :—--

“ When your butler's away, and the weather's so bad
That there is not a morsel of fish to be had,
A crust with some salt will soothe not amiss
The ravening stomach. You ask, how is this ἲ
Beoeuse for delight, at the best, you must look
To yourself, and not to your wealth or your cookl
Work till you perspire. Of all sauces 'tis best.
The man that's with over-indulgence oppressed.
white-livered and pursy, can relish no dish,
Be it ortolans, oysters, or finest of fish.
Stin 1 scarcely can hope, if before you there were
A peacock and capon, you would not prefer
With the peacock to tickle your palate. you're so
Completely the dupes of mere semblance and show.
For to buy the rare bird only gold will avan, “
And he makes a grand show with his fine painted tajl.
As if this had to do with the matter the least!
Can you make of the seathers you prize so a feast?
And, when the bird’s cooked‚ what becomes of its splendour Ρ
Is his flesh than the capon's more juicy or tender?
Mere appearance, not substance, then, ‚clearly it is,
Which bamboozles your judgment. So much, then, for this.''

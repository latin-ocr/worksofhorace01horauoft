lxxxii sze of Horace.

⁸ Where's my pomade? Look sharp ε’ you shout,
‘ Heavens! is there nobody about?

Are you all deaf?’ and, storming high

At all the household‚ off you fly.

When Milvius, and that set, anon

Arrive to dine, and find you gone,

With vigorous curses they retreat,

Which I had rather not repeat.”

Who could take amiss the rebuke of the kindly satirist‚
who was so ready to show up his own weaknesses? In
this respect our own great satirist Thackeray is very like
him. Nor is this strange. They had many points in
common—the same keen eye for human folly, the same
tolerance for the human weaknesses of which they were
so conscious in themselveS, the same genuine kindness
of heart. Thackeray's terse and vivid style, t00‚ is·
probably in some measure due to this, that to him, as to
Malherbe‚ Horace was a kind of breviary.

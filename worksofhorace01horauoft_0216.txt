ODE XIII.
To LYDIA.

YDIA, when so oft the charms
Of Telephus you bid me note,
Taunt me with his snowy arms,
Rosy cheek, and shapely throat‚
within my breast Ι feel the fires
Of wild and desperate desires.

Then reels my brain, then on my cheek
The shifting colour comes and goeS,
And tears‚ that flow unbidden, speak
The torture of my inward throe5‚
The fierce unrest‚ the deathless flame,
That slowly macerates my frame.

Oh agony Ξ to trace where he

Has smutched thy shoulders ivery-white
Amid his tipsy revelry ς

Or where, in trance of fierce delight,
Upon thy lips the frenzied boy
Has left the records of his joys*

'⁶ The allusions to this tiger-like ferocity of tenderness are frequentin
both ancient and modern poetS. Thus Plautus speaks of Teneris labellis
molles morsiunculae—the dainty nibbles of fond lips. Again, Tibullus,
recounting the many proofs of his affection which he had given to the
inconstant Delia, takes credit for having taught her how to obliterate
the traces of wounds inflicted in such amorous encounters :—

“ Tum succos herbasque dedi, queis livor abiret,
Quem facit impresso mutua dente Venus.''
-Ειεο, 1. vi. l. 15.

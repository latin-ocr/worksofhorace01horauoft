lxii Lzfi of Horace.

Which was behind, and that before which I had placed behind,
Yet by no alchemy will you in the residuum find
The members still apparent of the dislocated bard,”—

a result which he contends would not ensue, however
much you might disarrange the language of a passage of
true poetry, such as one 'he quotes from Ennius, the
poetic charin of which, by the way, is not very apparent.
Schooled, however, as he had been, in the pure liter-

For men are more imperious‚ as a rule,
To slashing censure than to ridicule.
Here lay the merit of those writers, who
In the Old Comedy our fathers drew ;

, to save him from the falling tree, and where another miracle

preserved him from the attack of the wolf as he strolled
along unarmed, singing of the soft voice and sweet smiles
os his Lalage! The brook is now nearly dammed up; a
wall of close-fitting rough-hewn stones gathers its waters
into a still, dark pool; its overflow gushes out in a tiny rill
that rushed down beside our path, mingling its murmur
with the hum of myriads of insects that swarmed in the
air.”

On this farm lovers of Horace have been fain to
place the fountain of Bandusia, which the poet loved
so well, and to which he prophesied‚ and truly, as the
issue has proved, immortality from his song (odes, III.
13). chau-ming as the poem is, there could be no
stronger proof of the poet's hold upon the hearts of men
of all ages than the enthusiasm with which the very site
of the spring has been contested.

¹⁸ Ο fountain of Bandusia!
Sparkling brighter in thy play,
Far than crystal, thou of wine 1
Worthy art, and fragrant twine
Of fairest flowers 1 To-morrow thou ·
A kid shalt have, whose swelling brow‚
And horns just budding into lise,
Give promise both of love and strife.
vain promise all 1 For in the spring
And glory of his wantoning,
His blood shall stain thy waters cool
With many a deep-cnsanguined pool.

 

¹ It seems strange that Horace should call the fountain worthy of
wine and flowers (the lesser sacrifice of Cain), when he was about to
offer it the greater sacrifice of Abel. Was the poem itself an adapta-

‘tion of some Greek lyric. in which the poet promised to sacrifice a kicl

to the sountain beside which he and his boon-companions were wont
to sit covered with flowerS, and to temper their wine in its waters ?

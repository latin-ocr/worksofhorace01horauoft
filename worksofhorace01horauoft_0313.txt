om: xz] To' Lyde. 12 1

Though countless serpents—sentinels full dread—
The ridges of his fateful brows empale,

And, loathly steaming‚ from his triple head
Swelters black gore, and poisonous blasts exhale.

E’en Tityus and Ixion grimly smiled
Through all their anguish, and a while hung dry
The toiling urn, whilst the sweet strain beguiled
The Danaids, that stood in soothed oblivion by.

In Lyde’s ear reverberate their guilt,
And its dread punishment, to draw for ever
A jar of water that is ever spilt‚
Through the pierced bottom lost in the sad-flowing river.

Show her the vengeance sure, howe’er delayed,
Which even in Orcus crimes like theirs must feel,

Those impious girls, stained with guilt's blackest shade‚
Those impious girls, who slew their lords with savage steel!

One only, worthy of the bridal bed,
Of all the train, was to her perjured sire λ
Magnificently false, and fame shall spread
Her praise through endless time, linked to the living lyre.

“ Rise, rise !'' Thus to her youthful mate she spoke,
‘⁴ Lest thou from hands, whose guilt is little feared,
Receive a sleep that never shall be broke!
F ly from my father false and ruthless sisters weird!

“ Who now, like lions ravening o’er their prey,
Butcher their wedded lords, alas, alas!
1 strike thee not—I, gentler·souled than they,
Nor keep thee prisoned here, but bid thee sreely pass,

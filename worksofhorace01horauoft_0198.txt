ODE 11.
‘ro AUGUSTUS cAEsAR.

NOUGH of snow, enough of direful hail
Hath Jove in anger showered upon the land,
And launching havoc with his red right hand
On tower and temple, made the city quail‚—

Made all the nations quail, lest Pyrrha's age
Should come again, with brood of monsters strange,
When Proteus drove his ocean-herd to range

The mountain-tops in wondrous pilgrimage ;

And fish were tangled in the branching clm,
The brooding stock-doves haunt in days of yore,
And roe-decr swam affrighted 'mid the roar

Of seas that did their native glades o'erwhelrn.

The yellow Tiber‚ with its waves hurled back
From the Etruscan coast, have we beheld,
Threaten the monuments of regal eld,

And Vesta's fane, with universal wrack.

Rising in ire, to avenge his Ilia’s plaint‚
He bursts his bounds, and, stirred through all his deep5‚
O’er his left bank the uxorious river sweeps,

Though unapproved by Jove, and spurns restraint.

T hinned by their parents' crimes, our youth shall hear
How Roman against Roman bared the blade,
Which the fierce Persian fitlier low had laid,

Shall h'ear, how kin met kin in conflict drear.

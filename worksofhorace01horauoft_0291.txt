In Praise of. Contentment. 99

The fish are conscious that a narrower bound
Is drawn the seas around
By masses huge hurled down into the deep ;
There, at the bidding of a lord, for whom
Not all the land he owns is ample room,
Do the contractor and his labourers heap
Vast piles of stone, the ocean back to sweep.
But let him climb in pride,
That lord of halls unblest,
Up to his lordly nest,
Yet ever by his side
Climb Terror and Unrest3
Within the braien galley's sides
Care, ever wakeful, flits,
And at his back, when forth in state he rides,
Her withering shadow sits.

If thus it fare with all;
If neither marbles from the Phrygian mine,
Nor star-bright robes of purple and of pall,
Nor the Falernian vine,

y Nor costliest balsams, fetched from farthest Ind,

Can soothe the restless mind3
Why should Ι choose
To rear on high, as modern spendthrifts use,
A lofty hall, might be the home for kings,
With portals vast, for Malice to abuse‚
Or Envy make her theme to point a tale3
Or why for wealth, which new-born trouble brings,
Exchange my Sabine vale?

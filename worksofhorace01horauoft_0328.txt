ODE XXIV.

TO THE COVETOUS.

THOUGH thou, of wealth possessed
Beyond rich Ind’s, or Araby's the blest,
Shouldst with thy palace keeps
Fill all the Tuscan and Apulian deeps,
If Fate‚ that spoiler dread,
Her adamantine bolts drive to the head,
Thou shalt not from despairs

Thy spirit free, nor loose thy head from death’s dark suares.

The Scythians of the plains

More happy are, housed in their wandering wains,
More blest the Getan stout,

Who not from acres marked and meted out
Reaps his free fruits and grain:

A year, no more, he rests in his domain,
Then, pausing from his teil,

He quits it, and in turn another tills the soil.

The guileless stepdame there
The orphan tends with all a mother’s care;
No dowried dame her spouse
O'erbears‚ or trust the sleek seducer's vows;
Her dower a blameless life,
True to her lord, she shrinks an unstained wife
Even from another's breath;
To fall is there a crime, and there the guerdon death!

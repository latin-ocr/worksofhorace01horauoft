What with to-morrow comes forbear
To askff and count as gain
Each day fate grants, ere time and care
Have chilled thy blood, and thinned thy hair
Love's sweets do not disdain 3

Nor, boy, disdain the dance Ξ For, mark,
Now is thy time to take

Joy in the play, the crowded park,

And those low whispers in the dark‚
Which trysting lovers make ς

In the sweet laugh, that marks the spot
Where hid the fair one lies,†

The token from the wrist besought,

Or from the finger wmng, that not
Too cruelly denies.‡

‘⁸ What need a man forestall his date of grief,

And run to meet what he should most avoid? ''
—M1LT0N's Comus, 362.

“She seigns a laugh to see me search around,

And by that laugh the willing nymph is found.'·

-ΡοΡΕ,
“ Well-pleased I hoer the wh‘ispered ‘No 1·
The whispered ‘ No !’—how little meant ;
Sweet falsehood‚ that endears consent.”
—COLERIDGE.

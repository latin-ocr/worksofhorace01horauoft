clxiv Lzfi of Horace.

were erected to AugustuS, much against his will, and at
these men made their prayers or plighted their oaths
every day. There is not a word to imply either that
Augustus took these divine honourS, or that Horace
joined in ascribing them, seriously.

It is of some importance to the argument in favour of
Horace's sincerity and independence, that he had no
selfish end to serve by standing well with Augustus.
We have seen that he was more than content with the
moderate fortune secured to him by Maecenas, Wealth had
no charms for him. His ambition was to make his mark
as a poet. His happiness lay in being his own master.
There is no trace of his having at any period been swayed
by other vieWS. What then had he to gain by courting
the favour of the head of the state? But the argument
goes further. When Augustus found the pressure of his
private correspondence too great, as his public duties
increased‚ and his health, never robust, began to fail,
he offered Horace the post of his private secretary.
The poet declined on the ground of health. He con-
trived to do so in such a way as to give no umbrage by
the refusal 3 nay, the letters which are quoted in the life
of Horace ascribed to Suetonius show that Augustus
begged the poet to treat him on the same footing as if
he had accepted the office, and actually become a mem-
ber of his household. “Our friend SeptimiUS‚'' he says
in another letter, “will tell you how much you are in my
thoughts3 for something led to my speaking of you before
him. Neither‚ if you were too proud to accept my friend-
ship‚ do I mean to deal with you in the same spirit.'’

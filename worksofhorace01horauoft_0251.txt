BOOK II.

ODE Ι.
To Asmms POLLIO.

THE civil broils that date
Back from Metellus’ luckless consulate,
The causes of the strife‚
Its viceS, with fresh seeds of turmoil rife,
The turns of fortune's tide,
The leagues of chiefs to direful ends allied,
The arms of Romans wet
With brother's blood, not expiated yet,
These are thy chbsen theme,
An enterprize that doth with peril teem,
For everywhere thy tread
On ashes falls, o'er lulled volcanoes thinly spread!

Mute for some little time

Must be the Muse of tragedy sublime
Within our theatres; anon,

The task of chronicling our story done,
Thy noble bent pursue‚ ’

And the Cecropian buskin don anew,

’ Pollio, thou shield unstained

Of woful souls, that are of guilt arraigned,
On whose persuasive tongue

The senate oft in deep debate hath hung,
Whose fame for laurels won

In fields Dalmatian shall through farthest ages run!

, were all eagerness to make his cause their own. Horace,
infected by the general enthusiasm, joined his standard3
and, though then only twenty-tw0, without experience,
and with no special aptitude, physical or mental, for a
military life, he was intrusted by Brutus with the com-
mand of a legion.1 There is no reason to suppose
that he owed a command of such importance to any
dearth of men of good family qualified to aet as officers.
It is, therefore, only reasonable to conclude, that even
at this early period he was recognised in⁴the brilliant
society around him as a man of mark3 and that Brutus,
before selecting him, had thoroughly satisfied himself
that he possessed qualities which justified so great a
deviation from ordinary rules, as the commission of so
responsible a charge to a freedman's son. That Horace
gave his commander satisfaction we know from himself.
The line (EpistleS, Ι. xx, 23), “lise primis urbis belli
placuisse domique,''—

‘¹ In war, as also here at home,
I stood well with the foremost men of Rome,”

can be read in no other sense. But while Horace had,
beyond all doubt, made himself a strong party of friends
who could appreciate his genius and attractive qualitieS,
his appointment as military tribune excited jealousy
among some of his brother officerS‚ who considered that
the command of a Roman legion should have been re-

1 A legion was composed of 6000 men. Over each legion were six
tribunes. Exception has been taken to the statement in the text by
some critics who think that Horace’s command was merely nominal.
’ Had it been so, Horace would have been very unlikely to have called
attention, as he does, in the Sixth Satire of the First Book, to the fact
that he had been intrusted with a merely nominal command.

T ο Septimia& [Boon 11.

And then will thy Lalage long for a lord,
Nor shrink from the secrets of conjugal joy;
By thee she will be, too, more fondly adored,
Than Pholoe's self, or than Chloris the coy,
Her beautiful shoulders resplendently white
As the moon, when it silvers the ocean by night3

Or as Gnidian Gyges, whom were you to piace
In the midst of a bevy of sunny-browed girls,
So boyish‚ so girlish at once is his face,
So silken the flow of his clustering curls,

’Twould puzzle the skilfullest judge to declare,

If Gyges or they were more maidenly fair.

ODE VI.
‘ro SEPTIMIUS.

EPTIMIUS, thou who wouldst, I know,
With me to distant Gades g0,
’ And visit the Cantabrian fell,
Whom all our triumphs cannot quell,
And even the sands barbarian brave‚
Where ceaseless' seethes the Moorish wave ;

May Tibur, that delightful haunt,
Reared by an Argive emigrant,
The tranquil haven be, 1 pray,
For my old age to wear away,
Oh, may it be the final bourne

To one with war and travel worn Ξ

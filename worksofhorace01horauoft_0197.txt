om: 1.] To M oecenas. 5

If nor Euterpe hush her suain,

Nor Polyhymnia disdain

To strike for me her Lesbian lyre,
And fill me with a poet’s fire.

Give me but these, and rank me 'mong
The sacred bards of lyric song,

1⁷11 soar beyond t'he lists of time,
And strike the stars with head sublirne.·’⁶

'* A kindred aspiration, but more nobly expressed‚ is that of Words-
worth :—
¹⁸ Blessings be on them, and exemal praise,

Who give us nobler loves, and nobler cates,
Τὴε poets who on earth have made us heirs

Of truth and pure delight in heavenly lays 1
Oh, might my name be numbered among their-s,

Then gladly would I end my mortal days J ’'

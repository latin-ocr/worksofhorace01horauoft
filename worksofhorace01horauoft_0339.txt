To M oecenas.

And flocks‚ and houseS, all in drear
Confusion tossed from shore to shore,

While mountains far, and forests near
Reverberate the rising roar,

When lashing rains among the hills

To fury wake the quiet rills.

Lord of himself that man will be,
And happy in his life alway,

Who still at eve can say with free
Contented soul, “ I've lived to-day 1*

Let Jove to-morrow, if he will,
With blackest clouds the welkin fill,

“ Or flood it all with sunlight pure,
Yet from the past he cannot take
Its influence, for that is sure,
Nor can he mar, or bootless make
Whate'er of rapture and delight
The hours have borne us in their flight.”

Fortune‚ who with malicious glee
Her merciless vocation plie5‚

Benignly smiling now on me,
Now on another, bids him rise,

³* ‘⁸ To·m0rrow 1 will live, the fool doth say3

To·dayitse1f's too late, the wise lived yesterday.''

‘¹ Ah, fill the cup ! What boots it to repeat
How Time is slipping underneath our feet :
Unbom To-morrow, and dead Yesterday,
Why fret about them, if To-day be sweet ?’'

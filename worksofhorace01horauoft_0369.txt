ODE XIII.

To Lych.

YCE, the gods have heard my prayer,
The gods have heard your ill-used lover,
You still would be thought both young and fair,
But you've lost your looks, and your heyday’s over :
You may tipsily wauton, and quaver, and trill,
’ But the love you would 'waken will slumber on still.

I'hzthe dimples of Chia's fair cheek he lies,
Chia that lilts to her lyre so sweetly 3
From crab-trees insipidvand old he flieS,
And you, Lyce, you he forswears completely3
For your teeth don’t keep, ancl your wrinkles are deep,
And your forehead is snow-capped‚ and rugged, and steep.

Not purple of cos, nor' genis star-bright‚

Can recall the days that are gone and going;
Oh, where is the bloom and the smile of light,

And the step of grace, self-poised and flowing?
What of her, in whose breath was love's flame, is left,
Of her, who my soul of itself bereft? ’

 

Thou to Cinara next sor charm of face,
Ρ And love-luring wiles on my heart wert gravem
’ - But Cinara died in her youth’s fresh grace,
’ Whilst thou art like to outlive the raven,
Dying down, a spent toi-ch, into ashes and smoke,

The butt of each roystering youngster’s joke 2

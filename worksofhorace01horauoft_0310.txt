ODE IX.
THE RECONCILIATION.

HORACE.

. HILST 1 was dear and thou wert kind,
And Ι, and Ι alone might lie
Upon thy snowy breast reclined,
Not Persia's king so blest as 1. ⁹

LYmA.

Whilst 1 to thee was all in all,

Nor Chloe might with Lydia vie,
Renowned in ode or madrigal,

Not Roman Ilia famed as 1.

HORACE.

1 now am Thracian Chloa’s slave,

With hand and voice that charms the air,
For whom even death itsels I’d brave,

So sate the darling girl would spare‘ff

mmm.
Ι dote on Calais—and 1

Am all his passion, all his c 3
For whom a double dfflig,
So fate the darling boy would spare Ξ

HORACE.

What, if our ancient love return,
And bind us with a closer tie,

If 1 the fair-haired Chlo& spurn,
And as of old for Lydia sigh?

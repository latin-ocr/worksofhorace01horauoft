habits and feeble health, who found it hard enough to
⁶ keep pace with the milder dissipations of the social
circle. We are absolutely without any information as to
these ladieS, whose liquid and beautiful names are almost
poems in themselves; nevertheless the most wonderful
romances have been spun about them out of the inner
consciousness of the commentators. Who would venture
to deal in this way with the Eleanore, and “ rare pale Mar-
garet‚'' and Cousin Amy, of Mr Tennyson?1 And yet
to do so would be quite as reasonable as to conclude, as

¹ some critics have done, that such a poem as the follow-

 

ing (Odes, Ι. 2 3) was not a graceful poetical exercise
merely, but a serious appeal to the object of a serious

passion :—

⁴¹ Nay, hear me. dearest Chloe, pray !
You shun me like a timid fawn,
That seeks its mother all the day
By forest brake and upland lawn,
Of every passing breeze afraid,
And leaf that twitters in the glade.

¹ This viewhas been confirmed by M. Richard (de Nancy) in his
‘Commentaire Physiologique sur la personne d’Horace :’ Lyon, 1873.
“Horace, in middle life,'' he says, “with a bad figure, weak eyes, and
hair alroedy white, could not, whatever he may say to the contrary, be
well received by Cinara, Leuconoe, Tyndaris, Chloe, Lydia, Pyrrha,
Bar-ine, Neobule, Chlon's, Galatea, Phyllis, Phryne, and so many others.
We might as well imagine that if our Beranger, with the homely
fatherly countenance represented in the popular prints——that if this
little man, with his bald head and round eyes, wrapped up in his ample
evacuat, had sung his refrains in person to Luzon, Rose. Octavie, or
Jaenneton, he would have been well received by themlst' The little
-traetise from which the above extract is taken gives the results of the
applimtion of the science of an able physiologist to the facts of Horace's
physioel peculiarities, as gleaned from his own works.

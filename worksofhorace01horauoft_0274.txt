ODE XIV.
To POSTHUMUS.

H, Posthumus, the year5‚ the fleeting years¹
Stin onwafds, onwards glide 3 ’
Nor mortal virtue may
Time's wrinklihg fingers stay,
Nor Age’s sure advance, nor Death's all-conquering stride.

Hope not by daily hecatombs of bulls

From Pluto to redeem ’

Thy life, who holds thrice vast

Geryon settered fast,

And Tityus, by the waves of yonder rueful stream.

Sad stream, we all are doomed one day to cross,
Ay, all that live by bread,

Whate'er our lot may be,

Great lords of high degree,

Alike with peasant churls, who scantily are fed.

In vain shall we war's bloody conflict shun‚

And the hoarse scudding gale

Of Adriatic seas,

Or fly the southern breeze,

That through the Autumn hours wafts pestilence and bale.

For all must view Cocytus' pitehy tide
Meandering slow‚ and see

The accursed Danaids moll,

And that dread stone recoil,

Sad Sisyphus is doomed to upheave eternally.

ODE XVI.

TO GROSPHUS.

FOR ease he doth the gods implore,
Who, tossing on the wide
AEgean billows‚ sees the black clouds hide
The moon, and the sure stars appear no more,
The shipman's course to guide.

For ease the sons of Thracia cry,
In battle uncontrolled,
For ease the graceful-quivered Mediaqghold,
That ease which purple, Grosphus, cannot buy,
Nor wealth of gems or gold.

For boarded treasure cannot keep
Disquietudes at bay,
Nor can the consul's lictor drive away
The brood of dark solicitudes, that sweep
Round gilded ceilings gay.

He lives on little, and is blest‚
On whose plain board the bright
Salt-cellar shines‚ which was his sire's delight,
Nor coward fears, nor sordid greed's unrest
Disturb his slumbers light.

62 To Crispus Sallustius. [Boon 11.

Dropsy, sels-pampered‚ grows ε its thirst
Burns on until what bred the flame
Forsakes the veins, and those thin humours burst

That waned the frame.

The crowd may call Phraates blest‚
Enthroned where Cyrus sat erewhile,

But Virtue never z she from words doth wrest
Their gloss of guile,

To him alone the diadem
Of empire giving, and the bays, ν
Who, passing treasure·heaps‚ not once on thern
Turns back his gaze.

J'oined with one of those characteristic strokes os irony, which blend so
pleasantly with his didactic vein.

“ Ad summam, sapiens uno minor est Jove, dives,
Liber, honoratus, pulcher, rex denique regum,
Proecipue sanus, nisi cum pituita molesta est.''

‘¹ In fine, the sage, unswayed by power or pelf,
Is only less than sovereign Jove himself:
To him wealth, honour. freedom. bauty clings;
He is, in short, a very king of kings,—-
Body and mind superior to all woes,
Save when he’s plag-ned by cold and running at the nose.”

ont: x111.] To a fallen Tree.

What wonder they their ears to feast,
Should thickly throng‚ when by these lays
Entranced, the hundred-headed beast
Drops his black ears in sweet amaze,
And even the snakes are charmed‚ as they
Among the Furies’ tresses play.

Nay, even Prometheus, and the sire ἦ
Of PelopS, cheated of their pains‚
Forget a while their doom of ire
In listening to the wondrous strains;
Nor doth Orion longer care
To hunt the lynx or lion there.··'·'·

ὕ “ Their song was partial, but the harmony
(What could it less, when Spirits immortal sing ?)
Suspended Heu, and took with ravishment
The thronging audience.'·

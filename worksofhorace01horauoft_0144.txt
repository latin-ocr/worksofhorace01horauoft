cxl Α Life of Horace.

fulness. On the contrary, the beautiful world, and the
delights it offerS, are made to stand out, as it were, in
brighter relief against the gloom of Orcus. Thus, for
example, this very gloom is made the background in the
following Ode (Ι. 4) for the brilliant pictures which crowd
on the poet’s fancy with the first burst of Spring. Here,
he sayS, O SestiuS, all is fresh and joyouS, luxuriant and
lovely! Be happy, drink in “ at every pore the spirit
of the season,'' while the roses are fresh in your hair,
and the wine-cup flashes ruby in your hand. Yonder
lies Pluto’s meagrely appointed mansion, and filmy
shadows of the dead are waiting for you there, to swell
their joyless rankS. To that unlovely region you must
g0, alas! too soon, but the golden present is yourS, so
drain it of its sweetS.

“As biting Winter flies, 10, Spring with sunny skies,

And balmy airs 1 and barks long dry put out again from shore ;
Now the ox forsakes his byre, and the husbandman his fire,

And daisy-dappled meadows bloom where winter frosts lay hoar.

By Cytherea led. while the moon shines overhead,
The Nymphs and Graees, hand in hand, with alternating feet

Shake the ground, while swinking Vulcan strikes the sparkles fierce and
Frotiieihe forges of the Cyclops, with reiterated beat.

’Tis the time with myrtle green to bind our glistening locks,

Or with flowers, wherein the loosened earth herself hath newly
And ῒοᾱζὲἶῗξὲἐε to Faunus in some glade amidst the rocks

A yearling lamb, or else a kid, if such delight him best.

Death comes alike to all—to the monarch’s lordly hall,
Or the hovel of the beggar, and his summons none shall stay.
Ο Sestius, happy Sestius 1 use the moments as they pass;
Far-reaching hopes are not for us, the creatures of a day.

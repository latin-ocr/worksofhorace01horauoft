ODE XXII.
To ARISTms FUSCUS.

FUSCUS‚ the man of life upright and pure
Needeth nor javelin, nor bow of Moor,

Nor arrows tipped with venom deadly-sure‚
Loading his quiver ;

Whether o’er Afric’s burning sands he rides,

Or >frosty Caucasus' bleak mountair'lssides,

Or wanders lonely, where Hydaspes glides,
That storied river)⁶

For as I strayed along the Sabine woncl,

Singing my Lalage in careless mood,

Lo, all at once a wolf before me stood,
Then turned and fied x

Creature so huge did warlike Daunia ne'er ⁷

Engender in her forests' wildest lair, ξ

Not Juba's land, parched nurse of lions, e'er ἦ
Such monster bred.

Place me, where no life-laden summer breeze

Freshens the meads, or murmurs 'mongst the treeS,

Where clouds oppress, and withering tempests freeze
From shore to shore.

And like a quivered Nymph, with arrows keen,
May trace huge forests and unharboured heaths,
Infamous bins, and sandy perilous wilds.''
—Comus, 421.

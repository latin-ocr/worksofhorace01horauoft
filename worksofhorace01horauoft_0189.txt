follow this indication, where, as frequently happenS‚ either
the names of persons or places, often most intractable,
but always important, must have been sacrificed, or a
measure selected into which these could be interwoven.
To be as literal and close as the difference between the
languages would admit, has been the aim throughout.
But there are occasions, as every scholar knOWS, where
to be faithful to the letter is to be most unfaithful to the
spirit of an author 3 and where to be close is to be hope-
lessly prosaiC. Phrases, nay, single words, and names,
rich in association5‚ and full of poetical suggestiveness
in one language, are bald, if not absolutely without sig-
nificance, in another. BesideS‚ even under the most
skilful hands, a thought or sentiment must at times be
expanded or condensed to meet the necessity of the
stanza. The triumph of the translator is, where this is
effected without losing any of the significance, or clash-
ing with the pervading sentiment, of the original. In
the translations of others who have made it their aim
Δ to imitate the Classical formS, the present *translator does
not find that, upon the whole, they escape the danger of
either adding to or subtracting from the language of the
original which besets the translator who adopts the more
familiar forms of English verse. Such translators are,
moreover, apt to forget that it is English verse, and for
English readerS, they are writing. Thus they fall into
the vices of a hybrid style, neither Latin nor English, in
which, to use old George Chapman's words—-

‘⁸ They lose
The fragrance of their natural dialect,
And shame their authors with a forced gloze.²‘

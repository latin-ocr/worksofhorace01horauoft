ODE vm.
TO MARCUS CENSORINUS.

UPS on my friends Ι would sreely bestow,

Dear Censorinus, and bronzes most rare,
Tripods carved richly, in Greece long ago

The guerdons of heroes, for them I would spare ;

Nor should the worst of my gifts be thine own,
If in my household art's marvels were rise,
Hero or god, wrought by Scopas in stone,
Or by Parrhasius coloured to life.

But unto me no such dainties belong,
Neither of them hast thou any dearth3
Song is thy joy, I can give thee a song,
Teach, too, the gist's all unmatchable worth.

- Not marbles graven with glorious scrolls
Penned by a nation with gratitudo due,
Records, in which our great warriors' souIs
T ameless by death ever flourish anew ἱ

Not flying enemies‚ no, nor with shame
Hannibal's menaces back on him hurled‚

Not fraudful Carthage expiring in flame,
Blazo'n his glory more bright to the world,

His surname from Africa vanquished who drew,
Than doth the Calabrian Muse by its lays :

And how, if your feats be unsung of, will you
Reap the full guerdon of life-giving praise?

clx Life of Horace.

When the Dircean swan doth climb
Into the azure sky,
Tbere poised in ether high,

He courts each gale, and fioats on wing sublime,
Soaring with steadsast eye.

Ι, like the matine bee, that sips
The fragrant thyme‚ and strays
Humming through leafy ways,

By Tibur's sedgy banks, with trembling lips
F ashion my toilsome lays.

But thou, when up the sacredsteep
Caesar, with garlands crowned,
Leads the Sicambrians bound, ,
With bolder hand the echoing strings shalt sweep,
And bolder measures sound.

Caesar, than whom a nobler son
The Fates and Heaven's kind powers
Ne'er gave this earth of ours,

Nor e'er will give, though backward time should run
To its first golden hours. ·

Thou too shalt sing the joysul days,
The city's festive throng,
When Caesar, absent long,

At length returns,-the Forum's silent wayS,
Serene from strife and wrong.

Then, though in statelier power it lack,
My voice shall swell the lay,
And sing, ‘ Ω glorious day,

Ο day thrice blest, that gives great Caesar back
To Rome, from hostile {ray i'

¹ Io Triumphe !' thrice the cry ;
‘ Io Triumphe 2· loud
Shall shout the echoing crowd

The city through, and to the gods on high
Raise incense? like a cloud.

Ten bulls shall pay thy sacrifice,
With whom ten kine shall bleed t
I to the fane will lead

A yearling of the herd, of modest size‚
From the luxuriant mead, ·

1 22 To Neobule, [Boox 111.

“ My sire may load my arms with cruel chains,
Because in pity I my lord did spare,

Or o'er the seas to far Numidia's plains
May banish me, yet all sor thee 1'11 gladly bear!

‘⁶ Go! speed thee hence, unsurl thy swelling sail‚
While Venus favours, and this midnight gloom!
The gods defend thy steps! And let the tale
Of what 1 loved and lost be graven upon thy tomb!

ODE ΧΙΙ.
'ro NEOBULE.

POOR maids to love's promptings
May never give play,
Nor wash in the wine-cup
Their troubles away ;
More dead than alive,
They are haunted by sear
To be scourged by the tongue
Of a guardian austere.

Cytherea’s winged urchin
From thee doth beguile
Thy work-box, and Hebrus
Of Lipara’s isle
From thy broidery weans thee,
And all the hard lore,
Which thou, N eobule,
Didst toil at of yore.

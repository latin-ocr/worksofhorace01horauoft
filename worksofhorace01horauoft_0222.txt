30 To Tyndaris. [noox 1.

But a kindlier mood hath my passion supplanted,
And music more gentle shall flow from my Inte,

Wouldst thou make me thy friend ,—my vile libels recanted‚—
And smile with reciprocal love on my suit Ξ

ODE XVI Ι.
To TYNDARIS.

Y own sweet Lucretilis ofttirne can lure
From his native Lycaeus kind Faunus the fleet,
To watch o'er my flocks, and to keep them secure
From summer’s fierce winds, and its rains, and its heat.

T hen the mates of a lord of too pungent a fragrance
Securely through brake and o’er precipice climb,

ι And crop, as they wander in happiest vagrance,

The arbutus green, and the sweet-scented thyme.

Nor murderous wolf, nor green snake may assail
My innocent kidlings, dear Tyndari5‚ when
His pipings resound through Ustica's low vale,
T ill each mossed rock in music makes answer again.

The muse is still dear to the gods, and they shield
Me their dutiful bard ς with a bounty divine

They have blessed me with all that the country can yield,
Then corne, and whatever Ι have shall be thine Ξ

Here screened from the dog-star, in valley retired,

Shalt thou sing that old song thou canst warble so well,
Which tells how one passion Penelope fired,

And charmed fickle Circe herself by its spell.

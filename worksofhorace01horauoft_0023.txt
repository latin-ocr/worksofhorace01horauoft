story, as he tells it himself, one is reminded of Burns’s
aerly lines about his father and himself :—

’· My father was a farmer upon the Carriek box-der,
And carefully he bred me up in decency and order.
He bade me act a manlyhpart, though 1 had ne'er a sarthing‚
For without an honest manly beart no man was worth regarding.'’

The parallel might be still further pursued. “My
father,'’ says Gilbert .BurnS‚ “ was for some time almost
the only companion we had. He conversed familiarly
on au subjects with us as if we had been men, and was
at great paim, while we accompanied him in the labours
of the farm, to lead the conversation to such subjects
as might tend to increase our knowledge, or confirm
us in virtuous habits.” How closely this resembles the
method adopted with Horace by his father will be seen
hereafter.¹

Horace's literary master at Rome was Orbilius Pupil-
luS, a grammarian, who had carried into his school his
martinet habits as an old soldier3 and who, thanks to

in the Second Satire of the Second Book, from line 114 to the end.

To Iulus A monins, [Boon ιν.

Or mourns the youth snatched from his bride,
Extols his manhood clear,

And to the starry sphere
Exalts his golden virtues, scattering wide
The gloom of Orcus drear.

When the Dircean Swan doth climb
Into the azure sky,
There poised in ether high,

He courts each gale, and floats on wing sublime,
Soaring with steadsast eye.

Ι, like the tiny bee, that sips
The fragrant thyme, and strays
Humming through leafy ways,

By Tibur's sedgy banks‚ with trembling lips
Fashion my toilsome lays.

But thou, when up the sacred steep
Caesar, with garlands crowned,
Leads the Sicambrians bound,

With bolder hand the echoing strings shalt sweep,
And bolder measures sound.

Caesar, than whom a nobler son
The Fates and Heaven's kind powers
Ne'er gave this earth of ours,

Nor e'er will give, though backward time should run
To its first golden hours.

Thou, too, shalt sing the joyful days,
The city’s festive throng,
When Caesar, absent long,

At length returns,—the Forum's silent ways
Serene from strife and wrong.

xxvi Life of Horace.

served for men of nobler blood—a Jealousy at which
he said, with his usual modesty, many years afterwards
(SatireS, I. vi. 45), he had no reason either to be sur-
prised or to complain.

In B.c. 43, BrutuS, with his army, passed from Mace-
donia to join Cassius in Asia Minor, and Horace took
his part in their Subsequent active and brilliant campaign
there. Of this we get some slight incidental glimpses
in his works, Thus, for example (odes, ΙΙ. 7), we find
him reminding his comrade, Pompeius Varus, how

·‘ F ull oft they sped the lingering day
Quaffing bright wine, as in our tents we lay,
With Syrian spikenard on our glistening hair.”

The Syrian spikenard, Malobatlzrum Syrium, fixes the
locality. Again, in the epistle to his friend Bullatius
(Epistles, Ι. 11), who is making a tour in Asia, Horace
speaks of several places as if from vivid recollection.
In his usual dramatic manner, he makes Bullatius
answer his inquiries as to how he likes the place he has

seen :—

¹⁴ You know what Lebedos is like: so bare,
With Gabii or Fidenae ’twould compare;
Yet there, methinks, Ι would accept my lot,
My friends forgetting, by my friends forgot,
Stand on the cliff at distance, and survey
The stormy sea-god's wild Titanic play.”-(Conington.)

Horace himself had manifestly watched the angry
surges from the cliffs of Lebedos, But a more interest-
ing record of the Asiatic campaign, inasmuch as it is
probably the earliest specimen of Horace's writing which
we have, occurs in the Seventh Satire of the F irst Book.

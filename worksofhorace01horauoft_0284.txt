ODE XIX.
To BACCHUS.

BACCHUS I've seen, (no fable is my song !)
Where far among the rocks the hills are rooted‚
His strains dictating to a listening throng,

Of nymphs‚ and prick-eared Satyrs cloven·sooted!

Evoe! The dread is on my soul even now,

Filled with the god my breast is heaving wildly!
Evoe ἒ Oh spare, Lyaeus, spare me, thou,

And o’er me wield thine awful thyrsus mildly!

Now may I dare to sing of Bacchants bold,
To sing of wine in fountains redly rushing,
Of milky streams, and honey's liquid gold
From hollow trunks in woods primeval gushing.

Now may 1 ebant her honourS, too, thy bride,
Who high among the stars is throned in glory,

The halls of Pentheus shattered in their pride,
And of Lycurgus the disastrous story.

Thee own as lord great rivers, barbarous seas ;

Thou, where afar the mountain peaks are shining,
Flushed with the grape dost revel, there at ease

Thy Bacchant’s locks unharmed with vipers twining.

Thou, when the banded giants, impious crew !
By mountain piled on mountain top were scaling
Thy sire's domains, didst hurl back Rhoecus, through
Thy lion's claws, and jawbone fell prevailing.

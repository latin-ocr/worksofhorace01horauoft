ODE 1.

ΤΟ MAECEN AS.

. ὃ, ’ AECENAS, scion of a race

v Of kings, my fortunes' crowning grace
¹ And constant stay, some men there are,
' Who joy to gather with the car
vOlympic dust; and whom the goal

By hot wheels cleared, that round it roll,

And noble palm, can elevate

To gods, the lords of earth's estate Ξ

 

One feels his breast with rapturo throb,
If the Quiritians’ fickle mob
Ra'ise him, ’mid brawl and civie roar,
To honours doubled o’er and o’er;
Another if he stote, and fill
His private granaries, until
Their teeming area contains
The harvests of all Lybia’s plains.

Him that delights afield to moil,
Tilling his old paternal soil,

, You ne’er could tempt, by all the pelf

Of golden Attalus himself,
With strong-ribbed Cyprian keel to creep,
NVhere Myrtos' island waters sleep.

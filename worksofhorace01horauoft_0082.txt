lxxviii Life of Horace.

Thee the fiery star, the hot

Breath of noonday toucheth not 3
Thou a grateful cool dost yield

To the flocks that range a-field.
And breathest freshness from thy stream
To the labour-wearied team.

Thou, too, shalt be one ere long

Of the fountains famed in song,
When I chant the ilex bending

O’er thy mosses, whence descending,

Several commentators maintain, on what appears to
be very inconclusive groundS, that the fountain was ,at
Palazzo, six miles from Venusia. But the poem is obvi-

della Corte '' seems to make out the strongest case for
itself. It is within a few hundred yards of the villa, most
abundant, and in this respect “fit '' to name the river that
there takes its rise, which the others-at present, at least
-certainly are not. ’

Horace is never weary of singing the praises of his
mountain home—“ Saleii· beatus unicis Sabinis,''

“ With what I have completely blest‚
My happy little Sabine nest ''—(Odes, 11. 18.)

are the words in which he contrasts his own entire happi-
ness with the restless misery of a millionaire in the midst

Canz‘dz‘a’s Incantation. xliii

‘⁸ Then comes my hour of triumph, then
1⁹11 goad you till you writhe again3
Then shall you curse the evil hour
You made a mockery of my power.”

She then triumphantly reasserts the powers to which she
lays claim. What! I, she exclaims, who can waste life
as the waxen image of my victim melts before my magic
fire 1—I, who can bring down the moon from her sphere‚
evoke the dead from their asheS‚ and turn the affections
by my philtre5‚—

“ Shall Ι my potent art bemoan
As impotent ’gainst thee alone?’'

Surely all this is as purely the work of imagination as
Middleton's “Witch‚’' or the Hags in “ Macbeth‚'’ or in
Goethe's ‘Faust.' Horace used Canidia as a byword
for all that was hateful in the creatures of her craft, filthy
as they were in their lives and odious in their persons.
His literary and other friends were as familiar with her
name in this sense as we are with those of Squeers and
Micawber‚ as types of a class 3 and the joke was well
understood when, many years after, in the 8th of his
Second Book of SatireS, he said that Nasidienus’s dinner-
party broke up without their eating a morsel of the dishes
after a certain point,—-“As if a pestilential blast from
Canidia's throat‚ more venomous 'than that of African
viperS‚ had swept across them.”

¹ Thus Hecate in Middleton’s “Witch'' assures to the Duchess os
Glo’ster '⁴ a sudden and subtle death '’ to her victim :—
“ His picture made in wax, and gently molten

By a blue fire, kindled with dead men's eyes,
Wiu waste him by degrees.”

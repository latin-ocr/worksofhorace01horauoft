cx szfe os Horace.

Let but the wind with sudden rush
The whispers of the wood awake, .
Or lizard green disturb the hush.
Quick·darting through the grassy brake,
The foolish frightened thing will start,
With trembling knees and beating heart.

But 1 am neither lion fell
Nor tiger grim to work you woe;
Ι love you, sweet one, much too well,
Then cling not to your mother. so,
But to a lover's fonder arms
Confide your ripe and rosy charms.”

Such a poem as this, one should have supposed, might
have escaped the imputation of being dictated by mere
personal desire. But no 3 even so acute a critic as Walck-
enaer will have it that Chloe was one of Horace’s many
mistresses‚ to whom rhe fied for consolation when Lydia,
another of them, played him false, “et qu'il l’a recher-
chee avec empressement.” And his sole ground for this
conclusion i's the circumstance that a Chloe is mentioned
in this sense in the famous Dialogue, in which Horace
and Lydia have quite gratuitously been assumed to be
the speakers, That is to say, he first assumes that the
dialogue is not a mere exercise of fancy, but a serious
fact, and, having got so far, concludes as a matter of
course that the Chloe of the one ode is the Chloe of the
other! “The ancients‚'' as Buttmann has well said,
“had the skill to construet such poems so that each
speech tells us by whom it is spoken 3 but we let the
editors treat us all our lives as schoolboy3‚ and interline
such dialogueS, as we do our playS‚ with the names,
Even in an English poem we should be offended at
seeing Collins by the side of Phyllis.” Read without

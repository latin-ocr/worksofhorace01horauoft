 

A Serenade. cxvii

The name given to such a serenade, adopted probably,
with the serenades themselves, from Greece‚ was para-
clausitlzyron—literally, an out-of-door lament. Here is
a specimen of what they were (odes, ΙΙΙ. 10), in which,
under the guise of imitating their form, Horace quietly
makes a mock of the absurdity of the practice. His
serenader has none of the insensibilty to the elements of
the lover in the Scotch song :—

¹⁸ Wi' the sleet in my hair, I'd gang ten miles and mair,
For a word 0' that sweet lip o' thine, o' thine,
For ae glauce o' thy dark e'e divine.''

Neither is there in his pleading the tone of earnest
entreaty which marks the wooer, in a similar plight, of
Burns’s “ Let me in this ae nicht ''—

¹‘ Thou hear'st the winter wind and weet‚
Nae star blinks through the driving sleet3
Tak' pity on my weary feet,
And shield me frae the rain, jo.”

There can be no mistake as to the seriousness of this
appeal. Horace’s is a mere jeu-d’esprit:-

'¹ Though your drink were the Tanais, chillest of rivers,
And your lot with some conjugal savage were cast,
You would pity. sweet Lyce, the poor soul that shivers
Out here at your door in the merciless blast.

Only hark how the doorway goes straining and croeking,

And the piercing wind pipes through the trees that surround
The court of your villa, while black frost is streaking

With ice the crisp snow that lies thick on the ground l

In your pride-Venus hates· it—no longer envelop ye,
Or haply you'll find yourself laid on the shelf 3

You never were made for a prudish Penelope,
'Tis not in the blood of your sires or yourself.

162 Tlte Praises of Drusus, [noox w.

“ Not Hydra, cleft through all its trunk,
With fresher vigour waxed and spread,

Till even Alcides’ spirit shrunk3
Nor yet hath Colchis dread,
Or Echionean Thebes more fatal monster bred.

“In ocean plunge it, and more bright
It rises ; scatter it, and lo!
Its unscathed victors it will smite
With direful overthrow,
And Rome's proud dames shall tell of many a routed foe.

“ No messengers in boastful pride
Shall Ι to Carthage send agaim
Our every hope, it died, it died,
When Asdrubal was slain‚
And with his fall our name’s all-conquering star did wane.’'

No peril, but the Claudian line
Will front and master it, for they
Are shielded by Jove’s grace divine,
And counsels sage alway
Their hosts through war’s rough paths successfully convey!

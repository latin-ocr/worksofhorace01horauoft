om: ιιι] To Lollius. 17 Ι

Not alone has Lacaenian Helena's gaze
Been fixed by the gloss of a paramour's hair,
’ By vestments with gold and with jewels ablaze,
By regal array, and a retinue rare;

Nor did Teucer first wield the Gydonian bow,

Nor was Troy by a foe but once harassed and wrung;
Nor Idomeneus only, or Sthenelus show

Such prowess in war as deserved tobe sung;

Nor yet was redoubtable Hector, nor brave
Deiphobus first in the hard-stricken field

By the dint of the strokes, which they took and they gave,
Their babes and the wives xof their bosom to shield.

Many, many have lived, who were valiant in fight,
Before Agamemnon ; but all have gone down,

Unwept and unknown, in the darkness of night,
For lack of a poet to hymn their renown.

Hidden worth differs little from sepulchred eases‘k
’ But, Lollius, thy farne in my pages shall shine;
1 will not let pale-eyed Forgetfulness seize
These manifold noble achievements of thine.

Thou, my friend, hast a soul‚ by whose keen-sighted range
Events afar off in their issues are seen,
A soul, which maintains itself still through each change
- Of good or ill fortune erect and serene.

ὕ “ For if our virtues
Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
As though we had them not.''
—Measuresor lllcasaecre. Act 1. Sc. 2. '

T lze Wz‘fe of Maecenas. lix

lineS, which point unequivocally to Maecenas’s wife, in
the following Ode addressed to her husband (Odes,
ΙΙ. 12) ?—- ·

⁸⁸ Would you, friend, sor Phrygia’s boarded gold,

Or all that Achaemenes· self possesses,

Or e'en for what Araby’s coffers hold,
Barter one lock of her clustering tresses,

While she stoops her throat to your buming kiss, ·
Or, sondly cruel, the bliss denies you,

She would have you snateh, or will, snatching this
Hersels, with a sweeter thrill surprise you ?’'

If Maecenas allowed his friends to write of his wife in
this strain, it is scarcely to be wondered at if that coquet-
tish and capricious lady gave, as she did, “that worthy
man good grounds for uneasiness.''

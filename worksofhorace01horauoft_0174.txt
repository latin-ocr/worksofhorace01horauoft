clxx Life of Horace.

man's aimS, let us add the picture of himself which Hor·
ace gives us in another and earlier Epistle (Ι. 18) :—

“ For me, when freshened by my spring's pure cold‚
Which makes my villagers look pinched and old,
What prayers are mine? ‘ Oh may I yet possess
The goods Ι have, or, if heaven pleases‚ less 1
Let the few years that Fate may grant me still
Be all my own, not held at others· will !

Let me have books, and stores for one year hence,
Nor make my life one flutter of suspense 1'
But I forbear3 sufficient ’tis to pray
To Jove for what he gives and takes away;
Grant life, grant fortune, for myself I'll find
That best of blessings-—a contented mind.''
—(Conington.)

“Let me have books!” These play a great part in
Horace' 5 life. They were not to him, what Montaigne

calls them, “a languid pleasure‚'’ but rather as they were
to Wordsworth—

“ A substantial world, both fresh and good,
Round which, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood,
Our pastime and our happiness may grow.¹’
Next to a dear friend, they were Horace's most cherished
eompanions. Not for amusement merely, and the list-
less luxury of the sels-wrapt lounger‚ were they prized by
him, but as teachers to correct his faultS, to subdue his
evil propensitieS, to develop his higher nature, to purify
his life (EpistleS, Ι. 1), and to help him towards attaining
“that best of blessingS, a contented mind :''—
“ Say, is your bosom ravaged by the fire
Of sateless avarice or of foul desire Ρ
Maxims there are and spells, the pain can ease,
And purge away nine-tenths of your disease.

Art mad for fame Ρ Through yonder volume spell
Again and yet again, and you’ll be well.

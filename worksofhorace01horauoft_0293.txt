ουκ 11.] To lzz's Companz‘ons. 101

Worth, all-indifferent to the spurns
Of vulgar souls profane,

The honours wears, it proudly earns,
Unelouded by a stain;

Nor grasps, nor lays the fasces down,

As fickle mobs applaud or frown.

Worth, which heaven's gate to those unbars‚
Who never should have died,

A pathway cleaves among the stars,
To mepner souls denied‚

Soaring in scorn far far away

From vulgar crowds and sordid clay.

For faithful silence, too, there is
A guerdon sure : whoe'er

Has once divulged the 'mysteries
Of Ceres' shrine, shall ne’er

Partake my roof, nor yet shall he

In the same vessel‘sail with me.

For oft has Jove, when slighted, swept
Away with sons of shame

The souls which have their whiteness kept,
And punishment, though lame

Of foot, has rarely failed to smite

The knave, how swift soe'er his ssight.

To Septimius.

But should the cruel F ates decree,

That this, my friend, shall never be,

Then to Galaesus, river sweet

To skin-clad flocks, will I retreat,

And those rich meads, where sway of yore
Laconian Phalanthus bore.

In all the world no spot there is,
That wears for me a smile like this,
The honey of whose thymy fields
May vie with what Hymettus yields,
WVhere berries clustering every slope
May with Venafrum’s greenest eope. —

There Jove aecords a lengthened spring,
And winters wanting winter's sting‚
And sunny Aulon's broad incline

Such mettle puts into the vine,

Its clusters need not envy those

Which fiery Falernum grows.

Thyself and me that spot invites,

T hose pleasant fields‚ those sunny heights ;

And there, to life's last moments true,
wilt thou with some fond tears hedew—
The last sad tribute love can leuel-—
The ashes of thy poet friend.

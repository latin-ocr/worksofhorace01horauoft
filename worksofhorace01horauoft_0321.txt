om: xv11.] To Aelius Lamia. 1 29

Haggard want with direful clamour ravins never at my door,

Nor wouldst thou, if more I wanted, O my friend, deny me
more.

Appetites subdued will make me richer with my scanty gains,

Than the realms of Alyattes wedded to Mygdonia's plains.

Much will evermore be wanting unto those who much demand ;

Blest, whom Jove with what sufficeth dowers‚ but dowers with
sparing hand.

ODE XVII.
'ro AELms LAMIA.

AELIUS, sprung from Lamos old,

That mighty king, who first, we're told,
Ruled sorted Formiae,

And all the land on either hand,
Where Liris by Marica's strand
Goes rippling to the sea3

Unless yon old soothsaying erow
Deceive me, from the East shall blow
To-morrow such a blast‚
As will with leaves the forests strew,
And heaps of useless algae too
Upon the sea-beach cast.

Dry saggots‚ then, house while you may 3

Give all your household holiday
To-rnorrow, and with wine

Your spirits cheer; be blithe and bold,

And on a pigling two moons old

Most delicately dine!

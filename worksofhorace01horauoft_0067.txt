Calvus and Catullus, lxiii

Here should we struggle in their steps to tread,
Whom fop Hermogenes has never read,

Nfor that mere ape of his, who all day long
Makes Calvus and Catullus all his song.''

The concluding hit at Hermogenes Tigellius and his
double is very characteristic of Horace's manner. When
he has worked up his description of a vice *to be avoided
or a virtue to be pursued, he generally drives home his
lesson by the mention of some well-known person's name,
thus importing into his literary practice the method taken
by his father, as we have seen, to impress his ethical
teachings upon himself in his youth. The allusion to
Calvus and Catullus, the only one anywhere made to
them by Horace, is curious 3 but it would be wrong
to infer from it that Horace meant to· disparage these
fine poets, Calvus had a great reputation both as an
orator and poet 3 but, except some insignificant frag-

of his love-verseS, which were probably of too sentimental
a strain for his taste, we may be sure that he admired the
brilliant genius as well as the fine workmanship of many
of his other poems. At all eventS, he had too much
good sense to launch a sneer at so great a poet recently

but might justly have been ascribed to jealousy. When
he talks, therefore, of a pair of fribbles who can sing
⁴ nothing but Calvus and Catullus, it is, as Macleane has
said in his note on the passage, “as if a man were to say
of a modern English coxcomb, that he could sing Moore's

1 extol with free heart, and with fancy as free
Her sweet face, fine ankles, and tapering arms,

How Ξ Jealous? Nay, trust an old sellow like me,
Who can feel, but not follow, where loveliness charms.

ODE V.
‘ro A FRIEND.

AVE patience! She's plainly too tender, you see,
The yoke on her delicate shoulders to bear,
So young as she is, fit she never could be
His task with the gentlest yoke-fellow to share,
Or brook the assault of the ponderous bull,
Rushing headlong the fire of his passion to cool.

At present your heifer finds all her delight
In wandering o’er the green meadows at will,
In cooling her sides, when the sun is at height,
In the iciest pools of some mountain-fed rill,
Or 'mid the dank osier·beds bounding·v in play
With the young calves, as sportive and skittish as they.

For unripe grapes to long is mere folly; soon, t00‚
Many-tinted Autumnus with purple will dye

Thy clusters that now wear so livid a hue;
And so after thee, soon, her glauces will fly,

For merciless Time to her count will assign

The swift·speeding years, as she takes them from thine.

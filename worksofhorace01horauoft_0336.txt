ΤΟ ΒΥΒὲ.

WHAT goodlier or fitter plan
Have I for N eptune's festal day?
Then forth the boarded Caecuban,
My Lyde, bring without delay‚
And for a season, if you can,
Fling wisdom's sober saws away!

You see the waning light decay,
And yet you pause and hesitate,—-
As though the day its flight would stay,-
To pluck down from its cellared state
Ἰᾜε amphora, was stored away
In Bibulus's consulate.

In alternating strains shall we
Sing Neptune, and the deep-green hair ,
Of N ereids sporting through the rsea3
And thou on curved lyre with fair
Latona, and the shasts so free
of Cynthia, shalt enchant the air.

And she, who Cnidos makes her care,
And dwells amidst the Cyclads bright,
And doth to Paphos oft repair
With team of swans for her delight‚
Shall have our closing song; and rare
Shall be our hymn in praise of Night.

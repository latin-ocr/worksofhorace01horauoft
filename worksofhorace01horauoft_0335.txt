om: xxv11.] T o Galatea, going to Sea. 143

Shameless my father’s hearth I fied!
Shameless I shrink from Orcus dread!
Place me, ye gods, in righteous wrath,
Naked upon the 1i0ns’ path,

Or give me, ere grief's wasting might
The bloom upon my cheeks shall blight‚
And sap my blood’s warm tide away,
To be the hungry tigers' prey!

‘⁴ Why, vile Europa, linger? Why?
I hear my absent father cry.
Quick, hang thee on yon ash Ξ Thy zone
Will serve thee—that is still thine own3
Or if yon cliff delight thee more,
These death-edged rocks, that strew the shore,
Then to the driving tempest give
Thyself, unless thou'dst rather live
A bondslave, carding servile wool,
'Neath some barbarian princess' rule,
And brook, though sprung of royal race,

A vulgar concubine’s disgrace !'’

As thus she poured her wail on high,
Venus the while stood laughing by,
And to her side, with bow unstrung,
Her boy, the rosy Cupid‚ clung.
When she of mirth her fill had ta’en,
“ This boiling rage,'’ she cried, “restrain,
Since yon detested bull shall bend
His horns for thee at will to rend.
Know'st not, thou art Jove's honoured bride?
Then dry thy tears, and own with pride
Thy mighty fortune, mightier fame,
For half the globe shall bear thy name 1”

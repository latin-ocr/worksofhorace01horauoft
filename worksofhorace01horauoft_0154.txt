cl' ’ · Life of Horace.

himself, in his introductory Ode, with a graceful defer-
ence, upon the judgment of Maecenas. Let that only
seal his lyrics with approval‚ and he will feel assured of
his title to rank with the great sons of song 2-

“ Do thou but rank me 'mong
The sacred bards of lyn'c song,
I'll soar beyond the lists of time,
And strike the stars with head sublime.’·

In the last Ode, also adressed to MaecenaS, of the
Second Book, the poet gives way 'to a burst of joyous
anticipation of future fame, figuring himself as a swan
soaring majestieally across all the then known regions of
the world. When he puts forth the Third Book several
years afterwardS, he closes it with a similar paean of
triumph, which, unlike most prophecies of the kind, has
been completely fulfilled. In both he alludes to the low-
liness of his birth, speaking of himself in the former as a
child of poor parents—“ pauperum sanguis parentum ,· '²
in the latter as having risen to eminence from a mean
estate—“ex humili· potens.'' These touches of egotism,
the sallies of some brighter hour, are not merely venial,
they are delightful in a man so habitually modest.

“ I’ve reared a monument, my own.
More durable than brass;
Yea, kingly pyramids of stone
In height it doth surpass.

Rain shall not sap, nor driving blast
Disturb its settled base,

Nor countless ages rolling past
Its symmetry deface.

Ι shall not wholly die. Some part,
Nor that a little, shall

Escape the dark Destroyer's dart,
And his gn'm festival.

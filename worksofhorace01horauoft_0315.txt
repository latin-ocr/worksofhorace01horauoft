A handsome young fellow
Is he, when he laves
His balm-dropping shoulders
In Tiber's dun waves3
Bellerophon’s self
Not so well graced a steed‚
He is peerless in boxing,
A racehorse in speed3

Expert‚ too, in striking
The stag with his spem,
NVhen the herd o’er the champaign
Fly panting in sear 3
Nor less ready handed
The boar to surprise,
Where deep in the shade
Of the covert it lieS.
